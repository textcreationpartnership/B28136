            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:205150:6"/>more than the Summ of Five Hundred Pounds to any one Person Principal Money, and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages.</hi> Now this <hi>Proviso</hi> was purposely insert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to prevent some Knavish <hi>Bankers</hi> that were some time before Broke for great Summs of Money, from taking the Benefit of the said Act, and not to detain the Honest <hi>Gentleman, Merchant,</hi> and <hi>Tradesman,</hi> in Prison, who by unavoidable Losses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are Ruined and Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned. But I, with all Humility, leave it to the Wise Consideration of this present <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> Whether they ought not to make Good Their <hi>Majesties Pious Inclinations, and Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to Relieve Their poor Distressed Subjects in Prison, than any other Kings and Queens Their Predecessors,</hi> by throwing open the Prison-Doors without any <hi>Proviso</hi> of a limited Summ, and let the Captives go free. And so I pass on to give the <hi>Reader</hi> an Account how I came to the knowledg of these Tragedies here related. Æ²pon <hi>Saturday</hi> the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>April, 1689,</hi> I was brought Prisoner into the <hi>Fleet-Prison, London,</hi> on the <hi>Monday</hi> after came to me Two Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and told me, They had a Bill in the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> for the Relief of poor Imprisoned <hi>Debtors,</hi> and desir'd my Charity towards the Charges of Carrying it on; upon which I gave them my <hi>Mite;</hi> but the <hi>Parliament</hi> sometime after being Dissolv'd, that Bill was lost, and these Two Gentlemen disheartned in their Æ²n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings. Soon after this present <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> was Call'd, and then another Bill was put in by the Prisoners into the Honourable <hi>House
<pb facs="tcp:205150:7"/>of Commons,</hi> and there being a Prorogation this Bill was likewise lost. Æ²pon this, at the next Sessions of <hi>Parliament,</hi> the poor Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Debtors</hi> Petitioned the Honourable <hi>House of Commons</hi> to bring in another Bill for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, which was granted them; but before they could bring in their Bill, the Right Honourable <hi>Hugh Boscowin,</hi> Esq; one of Their <hi>Majesties</hi> Privy Council, out of his great Goodness and Charity, brought into the Honourable <hi>House of Commons</hi> this Bill which is now brought forth into an Act, and pass'd the Royal Assent the <hi>5th</hi> of <hi>January, 1690.</hi> Whilst these things were Transacting we the Prisoners of the <hi>Fleet</hi> Considering, that though both Houses of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> were very Charitable, and were very will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Relieve us the most Miserable; yet we well knew that the Fees due to their <hi>Clerks,</hi> and other <hi>Officers,</hi> besides Soliciting Fees, must be paid, upon this we call'd a Common-Hall the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>September, 1690,</hi> to make Choice of a Person to be a Collector, Treasurer, and Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser of what Moneys should be given by well dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Charitable People for the carrying on of this, or any other Bill, which is or shall be put in <hi>Parliament</hi> for the Relief of the poor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned <hi>Debtors</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> upon which they made Choice of my self under all their Hands, (which were in Number Seventy,) and also the Common-Seal of the said Prison. Æ²pon this, knowing that most Prisoners are very poor, I was resolv'd to study and contrive all the lawfull ways I could to raise Moneys, so that if possible
<pb facs="tcp:205150:7"/>the poor Prisoners might be Excus'd from ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing any towards the said Charges. Æ²pon this the first thing I did, I published in the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zette,</hi> that if any good people would be Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to poor Prisoners, in helping them to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys to pay the Charges of passing this Act, that they should send their Charity to my self a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner in the <hi>Fleet.</hi> The putting this in the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zette</hi> cost me Ten Shillings, but this way did not at all help us, for I never receiv'd one Farthing upon this Advertisement. At the same time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so I requested <hi>William Lee</hi> Esq; a Counseller of the <hi>Temple,</hi> to Treat with the Prisoners of the <hi>King's-Bench,</hi> they being Twenty times the Number of us in the <hi>Fleet,</hi> to see what they would be willing to pay towards the Charges of this Act; he did agree with them, that we of the <hi>Fleet</hi> paying one Third of the Charges, they of the <hi>King's-Bench</hi> would pay the other Two Thirds, (with which Agreement we of the <hi>Fleet</hi> were well pleased,) but they never perform'd their Agreement; all that they paid was but Fifty Five Shillings, as Witness Mr. <hi>John Hooks</hi> of <hi>Chffords-Inn,</hi> one of the Clerks of Mr. <hi>Joderel</hi> Clerk to the <hi>House of Commons.</hi> The next way I attempted to get Money, was by Begging of a small Congregation that came from abroad to hear one Mr. <hi>Tho Beaverley</hi> a Prisoner in the <hi>Fleer,</hi> who preached every Lords-Day in the Chappel of the said Prison, and there I got Six Pounds Twelve Shillings and Three Pence, whereof <hi>5 s.</hi> was given by the <hi>Warden</hi> of the <hi>Fleet.</hi> Then I employed a Friend to Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:205150:8"/>in <hi>Lumbardstreet,</hi> whom I was told was a very Charitable Man, and had great Summs of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity Money to bestow, and got the said Mr. <hi>Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verley</hi>'s Letter to him, but could not prevail with him to give one Penny. Then I thought with my self it would be prudence to apply my self to the <hi>Clergy,</hi> both Conformist and Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformist, (knowing that there was not a greater Charity to be perform'd in this World, than setting at liberty so many Thousand poor Imprisoned <hi>Debtors,</hi> as this Act would do,) the which I did, and accordingly I sent my Friends to them, particularly to the Dean and Chapter of â€” I sent a Letter, and also a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, under the Common-Seal of the <hi>Fleet,</hi> but could not get one Farthing, only my Friend that I employed, (who did belong to the said Church) gave me his Five Shillings, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther near Relation of my own, gave half a Crown, and this was all the Moneys that I could get from any that were Exempted from the Misfortune of a Prison. Then I apply'd my self to all my Fellow-Prisoners in the <hi>Fleet,</hi> and got most of them to Subscribe what they would give towards the Charges of the Act; some of them paid me their Subscription-Money, but others, (although several of them receiv'd the Benefit,) refused to pay, but notwithstanding I got of them in all <hi>20 l.</hi> But finding this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys would not pay the Charges of this Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> I was resolv'd to apply my self to all the Countrey-Gaols in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> to see what Moneys I could get from them;
<pb facs="tcp:205150:8"/>upon my diligent search and enquiry, I found out in all Sixty Five Prisons; I immediately wrote to them and gave them an Account, that we the Imprisoned <hi>Debtors</hi> had a Bill pend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Parliament</hi> for our Relief, and that both Moneys and Interest was necessary to carry it on to perfection, and therefore I did Advise them to Petition all the <hi>Members</hi> of their several <hi>Countreys,</hi> that they would promote the said Bill, and get it pass into an Act, and sent them a Petition in true form. I also Advised them to send what Moneys they could Raise among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or Friends, to help to pay the Charges; and also from time to time gave them an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count what progress was made in it; and to this purpose I sent away above Sixty Letters of a Post-Night, and always kept a Correspondency with them, to my great Charges. Æ²pon this they from all parts Wrote to me, that they had Petitioned their <hi>Parliament Men,</hi> as I Advised, particularly <hi>Fisherton</hi> Prison in <hi>Wiltshire,</hi> sent me word that they had Petitioned Thirty One of the <hi>Members</hi> of the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> and that they would send me <hi>6 l.</hi> as their <hi>Quota</hi> to help to pay Charges; and from <hi>York</hi> Castle they would send me <hi>8 l.</hi> for their <hi>Quota,</hi> and from most of the other Prisons, some promised me <hi>3 l.</hi> some more, and some less, and all this with the greatest Asseveration and Assurance, even Life it self, and with all the Expressions of Kindness and Gratitude, which Letters I have by me to produce upon occasion. But after all those fair promises, to this Day I never
<pb facs="tcp:205150:9"/>received one Penny from any of those Sixty Five Gaols I kept Correspondency with, but these mentioned; and I have also set down the full Summs I received from each Gaol, which is as followeth. First, the Name of the Gaol; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the Names of the Persons I received the Money of; and Thirdly, the Summs.</p>

                  <p>This is a True Account of all Moneys that I ever received towards carrying on this Bill, and I publish this faithfully to the World, that if any person whatsoever has given any thing towards carrying on this Act, to any Gaol, or Person, than what is here mentioned, they are Cheated of their Moneys, and those that have received the said Moneys ought to be call'd to Account for Abusing so great a Charity, and be severely punish'd for it.

                  <p>Now, <hi>Reader,</hi> I hope thou wilt believe this both a True and also a Reasonable Bill of Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, considering that I paid <hi>5 l. 18</hi> s. for the Copies of this Bill and the former, which I have told thee was lost, out of the <hi>18 l. 1 s.</hi> I
<pb facs="tcp:205150:10"/>Charg'd Mr. <hi>Joderel,</hi> so that in Reality, he had but <hi>12 l. 3 s.</hi> for his Fees, and I have Reason to believe, that the Right Honourable Sir <hi>John Trevor,</hi> one of the Lords Commissioners of the Great Seal, and Speaker of the <hi>House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> out of his great Charity did forgive his Fees, (for which we humbly thank him.) But now I presume the <hi>Reader</hi> would gladly know what I did to pay the Fees due for passing it at the <hi>House of Lords;</hi> the Fees due there were, as I was informed, <hi>30 l.</hi> for the payment of which my good Friend Mr. <hi>John Hearn</hi> a Minister, unto whom I stand indebted <hi>400 l.</hi> besides Interest, profer'd to pay Ten Pounds, provided that the Clog of <hi>100 l.</hi> might be taken off, and that the Act might pass without a limited Summ, (which if it had so past I should have had the Benefit of it,) and also my Worthy Friend Mr. <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Tyndall,</hi> who was one of my most diligent Soliciters, and did it <hi>Gratis,</hi> had prevail'd with a Charitable Lady to pay the other <hi>20 l.</hi> upon the like Condition. In the mean time I apply'd my self by Letters to several of the Lords, with whom I had the Honour te be Acquainted, Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them that the Bill might pass into an Act, if possible, without a <hi>Proviso,</hi> which if that could not be done, then to let it pass as it was sent them from the Honourable <hi>House of Commons.</hi> Their Honours Considering, that if they should make any Alteration in the said Bill, it might occasion a Conference with the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> and by doing so the Bill might be lost, for they were Adjourn'd the Day
<pb facs="tcp:205150:10"/>it pass'd the Royal Assent; for this Reason they pass'd the Bill as it was, and it being an Act of great Charity, the Right Honourable Sir <hi>Robert Atkins,</hi> Lord Chief Baron of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> and Speaker of the House of <hi>Lords,</hi> forgave his Fees, and all the other Fees due to their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers that Attend the House were likewise for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, for which we humbly thank their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours. And now <hi>Reader</hi> I think my self Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to give thee an Account how I came by this <hi>21 l. 12 s. 4 d.</hi> which I am out of pocket, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides what I have received) in carrying on this Bill. My Brethren <hi>Book sellers,</hi> and several of the Company of <hi>Haberdashers,</hi> (of which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany I am a Freeman) Considering how Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously I have been dealt with by <hi>Adiel Mill,</hi> and his Confederates, as Related in my CASE herewith Printed, have from time to time out of their Kindness and Charity sent me Moneys to keep me from Starving, (which I Gratefully Acknowledg, and Return them Thanks,) so by a Frugal way of Living, by Eating Milk, and Bread, and Cheese, and such Wholsom and Cheap Fare, and having a Plate of Flesh sent me every Lord's Day for my Dinner, by a Friend, I sav'd this said Moneys out of my Belly. And then I must further Thank the <hi>Booksellers</hi> for their kindness in Subscribing for a very Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Number of this small Book, without the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of which I, that have been concern'd in Printing of some Hundred of Thousands of Books in <hi>Folio, Quarto, Octavo,</hi> &amp;c. could not have been able at this time to have Printed
<pb facs="tcp:205150:11"/>this small Narrative. And now <hi>Reader</hi> I pass on to tell thee what Diffioulties I and my Friends met with in our progress in carrying on this Bill; I my self was a Confin'd Prisoner within the Doors of the Prison all this time, and notwithstanding the <hi>Warden</hi> of the <hi>Fleet</hi>'s Charity of <hi>5</hi> s. towards the Charges of the Bill, understanding that I was Industrious in this Affair, he deny'd me my Two <hi>Day-Writs,</hi> altho' I had paid <hi>14</hi> s. towards them; telling me, <hi>That I was endeavouring for an Act to Release Prisoners, whereby he should lose his Fees and Chamber-Rent;</hi> (for the former Acts of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, which are Reviv'd by this Act, forgive Chamber-Rent, and all Fees due to Gaolers,) and soon after that, under the speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pretence of my Non-payment of Chamber-Rent, altho' I had paid him as Related in my CASE, he threw me into the <hi>Wards</hi> (or <hi>Dungeon</hi>) of the Prison, where I have ever since Lodg'd with those that Beg at the Grate; and since I begun to Write this Epistle to the <hi>Reader,</hi> one of the said poor Begging Prisoners, whose Bed join'd to my Beds-Head, Died at <hi>12</hi> of the Clock at Night, I my self being in Bed; he was, as I am inform'd, a Burst Man, of a Corrupt Body, and full of Vermin. Many others of my Chamber-Fellows also being so Lousie, that the Vermin Crawled on the outside of their Cloths; (this <hi>Reader</hi> at present is my sad Condition.) Whilst the Bill was pending in the <hi>House of Lords,</hi> my Friends strugling to get off the Clog, (the <hi>Proviso</hi> of <hi>100 l.</hi>)
<pb facs="tcp:205150:11"/>my Friend Mr. <hi>Tyndall</hi> was Threatned to be knock'd on the Head by the Steward and poor Prisoners of the <hi>King's-Bench,</hi> that thought themselves within the Benefit of the Act. And I my self was also serv'd so by the Prisoners of the <hi>Fleet;</hi> but I told them, <hi>I valued not Dying, for I hop'd I was always prepar'd for it.</hi> These were the Difficulties and Troubles we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went.</p>
                  <p>Whilst our Bill was thus pending in both Houses, the Prisoners of the <hi>King's-Bench</hi> Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the Honourable <hi>House of Commons</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Marshall,</hi> Complaining of several Abuses Committed by him on the Prisoners; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this the <hi>House</hi> appointed a Committee to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect those Abuses, and also Abuses Committed by the <hi>Warden</hi> of the <hi>Fleet;</hi> when I saw these Votes, it came into my thoughts, that now I had an opportunity to discover the Grievances of Countrey-Prisons; upon this I wrote to them to send me their Grievances, upon which they sent me these Tragical Stories here in this little Book Related. The first that came to my Hands, was that of <hi>John Suckerman</hi>'s, Dated the <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>October, 1690,</hi> from <hi>Bury St. Edmonds</hi> in <hi>Suffolk:</hi> The Villanies therein Related of the Gaoler, and other Oppressors, did so far affect me, that I did immediately Print it. About this time the Committee of the <hi>House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> being met, Sir <hi>Jonathan Jennings</hi> was their Chair-Man, and they being impower'd by the <hi>House</hi> to send for <hi>Persons, Papers,</hi> and <hi>Records,</hi> the <hi>Committee</hi> were pleas'd to send
<pb facs="tcp:205150:12"/>for me to inform them of the Abuses of the <hi>Warden</hi> of the <hi>Fleet.</hi> The <hi>Warden</hi> refus'd to Obey their Warrant, pretending I was in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. So then the <hi>House of Commons</hi> was Mov'd about it, and the Speaker sent his own Warrant, before the <hi>Warden</hi> would carry me down before the Committee, which said War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant cost me a Guinea. That Afternoon the <hi>Warden</hi> was to carry me before the Committee, there was a Prisoner remov'd by <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> from <hi>Ipswich</hi> Gaol in <hi>Suffolk</hi> to the <hi>Fleet</hi> Prison (for a Debtor may be remov'd from any Gaol in <hi>England,</hi> by <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> to the <hi>Fleet,</hi> or <hi>King's-Bench,</hi> and to no other Prison, and the reason is, you cannot Charge any Prisoner in Execution in any Prison in <hi>England,</hi> that is only Committed to Prison on Meen Process, till you bring him up to one of these two Prisons.) The Æ²nder-Sheriff and the Gaoler came both into the <hi>Fleet</hi> with him, and I being call'd through a mistake into their Company, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd my Printed Letter from <hi>Bury,</hi> the which the Æ²nder-Sheriff <hi>Samuel Fisher</hi> took up and Read, and throws down on the Table, and Crys out, <hi>It was all Stuff.</hi> Æ²pon which I Answered him, <hi>Sir, What do you mean by calling it stuff, is it Truth, or not Truth?</hi> Æ²pon which I took out of my Pocket the Second Letter from <hi>Suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erman,</hi> Dated the <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>November, 1690,</hi> and Read it to them my self, and when I came to that passage, [<hi>And</hi> James King <hi>broke the Goatch of Beer,</hi>] they all fell into a very great Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and one of their Company Cries out to me,
<pb facs="tcp:205150:12"/>Mr. <hi>Pitt, Exe Homo.</hi> Now it seems this Gaoler of <hi>Ipswich</hi> was this same <hi>James King</hi> that broke the Goatch, (or Pitcher,) and was then Æ²nder-Keeper, and Father in Law to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick</hi> Gaoler of <hi>Bury;</hi> upon this the said <hi>King</hi> did confess he did break the Goatch, and Ask'd of me, if I knew any of the Prisoners that Wrote me these Letters? I told him, <hi>No, I did not, nor ever did hear that there was any such people in the World as he or them, till I receiv'd these Letters.</hi> Æ²pon which I urg'd them to tell me whether they were Truth, or not? They both told me, <hi>They could not well deny the matter.</hi> Then I told them, <hi>That they were so far from</hi> Stuff, <hi>that they were</hi> Crimes <hi>fit to be punish'd by the Judges.</hi> I further said to them, <hi>That I was just going before the</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee <hi>of the</hi> House of Commons <hi>appointed to hear the Complaints of the Prisoners against the</hi> Marshall <hi>of the</hi> King's-Bench, <hi>and</hi> Warden <hi>of the</hi> Fleet, <hi>and I would certainly make a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint against them, and other Gaolers and Under-Sheriffs, and therefore I did Advise them to meet me at the</hi> Committee, <hi>and contradict what my Letters did Accuse them with, if false, and Acquit themselves like Honest Men.</hi> But they desir'd to be Excus'd from so doing. But now <hi>Reader</hi> thou mayst think, that this Story of the Goatch, and many other Stories in this Book, is not worth Relating, for what great Cruelty was this in <hi>King</hi> the Gaoler to break an Earthen Goatch, worth <hi>4 d.</hi> and to spill <hi>6 d.</hi> in Beer. <hi>Reader</hi> I will shew thee the <hi>Cruelty</hi> and <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:205150:13"/>of it, (if my information be true.) There were Twelve Imprison'd <hi>Debtors,</hi> that had no Drink all Day, and in the Evening they join'd there Halfpenny a Man, and sent into Town there Goatch for Six Pence in Beer, having as much more in Town for their Moneys, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Drink, than they could have in the Gaol; and probably some of the poor Men had no more Money; but as soon as this Gaoler <hi>King</hi> saw this Goatch with Beer out of the Town, he broke it out of Malice to the poor <hi>Debtors,</hi> because they had not this Drink of him. Now suppose this thy own Case, that thou wert without Drink for Twenty Four Hours, and then having only a Halfpenny worth, thou wouldst think it very hard to lose it, and know not where to get more. But now I will give thee an Account of my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carried before the said <hi>Committee:</hi> Some few Days before, I sent to Sir <hi>Jonathan Jennings</hi> the Chairman, the Complaints of the <hi>Warden</hi> of the <hi>Fleet</hi> Printed in this little Book, all except that which concern'd my self, and that I then gave an Account of to the <hi>Committee,</hi> the <hi>Warden</hi> standing by and heard all; and the Chairman Ordered his Clerk to take all in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and did at the same time Read to the <hi>Warden</hi> all the said Complaint. When this was done, I offer'd to make my Complaint of the Bad Æ²sage of poor Imprisoned <hi>Debtors</hi> in Countrey Gaols, and to that purpose did produce these very Letters now here presented to thee, but Sir <hi>Jonathan Jennings</hi> told me, that it was not in their power to hear me, because they
<pb facs="tcp:205150:13"/>were not Impowered by the Votes of the <hi>House</hi> to Inspect Country Gaols, but Advis'd me to Petition the <hi>House</hi> about it; and that Worthy Gentleman Mr. <hi>Christy</hi> promised to deliver my Petition, and to speak to it; but nothing has been since done in these Matters.</p>
                  <p>And now, <hi>Reader,</hi> I cannot forbear to Acquaint thee with a passage which hapned whilst I was wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the last mentioned Paragraph of this my Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, which was, One of my Fellow-Prisoners calls me, and tells me, that there were Two Countrey-Men Asking to speak with me: I immediately went to them, and Askt them if they would speak with me? One of them, who I perceiv'd, was a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle heated with Drink, Askt me in a Rustick way, if I would Drink a Pot of Ale with him? I told him, I would: and upon this we went all Three toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and had Two Pots of Drink. I Askt him what Countrey-Man he was? He told me, he came from <hi>Bedford,</hi> and that he was a Prisoner there, and that he would spend one Shilling on me, and that he would give me a Pint of Sack, and that he came to see me, for he had seen several of my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the Prison, and that all that I had wrote to them was truth; for which she said he had a respect for me. I told him, he should not spend one Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on me, for I seldom Drank between Meals, but I thankt him for his kindness, and Askt him, if they did not receive a Letter from me, wherein I Advis'd them, if they had any Grievances they should send me word what they were? He told me, they had so, and they were about sending an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them to me, but they Considered they were
<pb facs="tcp:205150:14"/>under the Gaoler's Lash, and it might be the worse for them. For, saith he, we have a Privilege of Walking in the Prison-Yard Three Hours every Day, which the Gaoler often will not suffer us to do, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which, we have fallen together by the Ears. And then, saith he, a Prisoner was discharg'd, and there was due from him to the Gaoler Thirteen Shillings Four Pence. The Prisoner had sent for his Horse to carry him home, which Horse was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well worth Five Pounds, and the owner was prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Four Pounds Ten Shillings in his bearing; the Gaoler would have this Horse of him, but the Prisoner would not let him; upon this the Gaoler Lockt up the Prisoner, and would not let him go till he gave him his Horse for the Thirteen Shillings and Four Pence he ow'd him, and would never give him one Farthing more. And that he himself was in Prison for Three Pounds odd Shillings. That another was in Prison but for Thirty odd Shillings. Another in upon Execution this Six Months for Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Shillings Six Pence. And another upon Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this Twelve Months for Five Shillings, and that the Original Debt was but Fifteen Shillings, and that he had paid Ten Shillings of it; and that Complaint of this was made to the Judges at the Assizes, and the Judges sent both for the Gaoler and the Attorneys concern'd; but they being in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy kept out of the way till the Judges were gone, and so the poor Men are in Prison still, and intend to take the benefit of the Act. The Name of him that is in Execution for Five Shillings, (as he told me,) is <hi>Stephen Holmes. Tell it not in</hi> Gath, <hi>publish it not in the Streets of</hi> As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kelon,
<pb facs="tcp:205150:14"/>
                     <hi>lest the Danghters of the</hi> Philistines <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, lest the Daughters of the Uncircumcised Triumph.</hi> And here, <hi>Reader,</hi> I will tell thee my own Observation, I have been a Prisoner in the <hi>Fleet</hi> above this Two Years, and I never, to my Remembrance, knew any Prisoner brought hither for Debt, that ever paid the full Debt that he was cast into Prison for, and went fairly out by so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (for its a true Proverb, <hi>A Prison pays no Debts,</hi>) and I further say, That where there is one Creditor that gets his real Debt by Arresting his Debtor, and casting him into Prison, there are Ten Creditors that lose all by doing so, and there are many substantial Reasons may be given for it. <hi>Prisons</hi> are Afflictions to the Good, the Vertuous, and Honest Debtor, for they will do their utmost Endeavours, by parting with all their Estates they have to pay their Just and Honest Debts; which if that will not do, and their Creditors be Æ²nmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to them, they must be Content, and submit to the Misfortune of a Prison, and the Tyranny of a Gaoler; and to have both their Eyes and their Ears open to the Wicked Practises of the Vilest of Men, <hi>Such as</hi> Job <hi>scorn'd to put among the Dogs of his Flock.</hi> So that they may justly say with <hi>David, Wo is me, that I sojourn in</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sech, <hi>that I dwell in the Tents of</hi> Kedar. But on the contrary, <hi>Prisons</hi> are Sanctuaries to Cheats and Villains, for as soon as they are brought into a <hi>Prison,</hi> they being flush'd with Honest Creditors Moneys, they enter into Combination with the Gaoler for to Cheat their Creditors; and by Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and Feasting the Gaoler, and those in Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy
<pb facs="tcp:205150:15"/>with him, they Enjoy all the Liberty their own Wicked Hearts can Wish; they have the Liberty of their Rules, (which no Man knows how far they reach,) they turn Night in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Day, and Day into Night, by <hi>Drinking, Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, Dycing, Roaring, Swearing, Cursing, Blaspheming,</hi> and all other ways of Debauchery; this with grief of Heart I see with my Eyes, and bear with my Ears. And to shew thee, <hi>Reader,</hi> what kind of Persons those are that Prisons are a Sanctuary to, I will give thee one Story of one of the Gaoler's Favorites, that has a considerable E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, which by parting from it, might for ought I know satisfie all his Creditors, but he had rather spend it in a Gaol on his Lusts. This Man meeting me one Day in the Yard of the Prison, tells this Story following of himself, <hi>That he being a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner in a Countrey-Gaol, He broke the Prison, and not only let himself out, but several of his Fellow-Prisoners: but they being afterwards taken, and the Gaoler being satisfied that this Person was the Man that broke the Prison, got Pardons for all the rest, and he at last being taken, was Try'd for the Fact, but before his Tryal, he found out one of his Fellow-Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners who had his Pardon, &amp; was also freed from his Imprisonment, and perswaded him, that he would appear at the Assizes, and Swear that he himself broke the Prison, and not he who was Indicted for it. Telling him, he could not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for it, because he had his Pardon, for which Service he would new Cloth him, and put Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys into his Pocket; upon which the Business
<pb facs="tcp:205150:15"/>was done effectually, and he came off with flying Colours.</hi> He told me this Story by way of Boasting. I Ask'd him, <hi>If he never Repented of this? Repent,</hi> saith he, <hi>No, for what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son have I, it was</hi> Se Defendendo, <hi>Man.</hi> Æ²pon this I forsook my Fellow-Prisoner. Another Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that had been a Knavish Banker, and broke for several Thousands of Pounds, having a mind to be in favour with the Gaoler, whereby he might live at Ease, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> presented the Gaoler's Wife with a pair of <hi>Silver-Candlesticks</hi> of the Value of Thirty Pounds, and some time after Died. The Gaoler's Wife, when she heard he was Dead, <hi>Well,</hi> saith she, <hi>there is a good Man Dead, and if ever any Man went to Heaven, that's the Man, for he gave me my Silver-Candlesticks.</hi> Thus, <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> thou mayst see what esteem the person <hi>Bribed</hi> has for the <hi>Briber,</hi> little Considering the Fatal Consequences that attend this Monster Sin. <hi>Bribe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> is a Root that beareth <hi>Gall</hi> and <hi>Wormwood,</hi> for it brings forth <hi>Oppression, Extortion, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, Perjury, Subornation</hi> of <hi>Perjury, Breach</hi> of <hi>Trust;</hi> it's a Fire that consumeth to Destruction <hi>Kingdoms, Persons,</hi> and <hi>Families;</hi> for this Sin God will destroy for ever, he will pluck the <hi>Briber,</hi> and the <hi>Bribed,</hi> out of the dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place, and Rout them out of the Land of the Living. And although great Men, Men in high places, in all Ages, have not been Ignorant of the Fatal Consequence of this Monster Sin, yet few of them can say with that Good Man <hi>Samuel, Here I am, Witness against me before the Lord, and before the King: whose Ox have I taken? Or
<pb facs="tcp:205150:16"/>whose Ass have I taken? Or whom have I De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded? Whom have I Oppressed? Or of whose Hand have I received any Bribe to blind mine Eyes therewith, and I will restore it</hi> But this good Prophet had no sooner made his Sons Judges in <hi>Israel, But they walked not in his ways, but turned aside after Lucre, and took Bribes, and perverted Judgment.</hi> This Sin of <hi>Bribery</hi> was Rife in the Days of <hi>David,</hi> and therefore he prays to God, <hi>Not to gather his Soul with Sinners, nor his Life with Bloody Men: In whose Hands were Mischief: And their Right Hand was full of Bribes.</hi> And the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> tells the House of <hi>Israel,</hi> in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

In the Days of that good Prince <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery</hi> was a Reigning Vice even at the Court it self, Witness that Famous Court-preacher, and afterwards Martyr, Father <hi>Latimer,</hi> in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons before that young Prince, and his Nobles; in one of which he tells this Story, inveighing against <hi>Bribery, My Lords,</hi> saith he, <hi>I will tell your Lordships a Story, There was one of your Lordships had a Living lately fallen in his Gift, a Countrey-Parson who had a mind to the said Living, comes to his Lordships House, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires to speak with his Honour, but his Lordship
<pb facs="tcp:205150:16"/>sends the Parson word, he was busie, he must come another time. The Parson desires the Messenger to present his Service to his Lordship and to give his Lordship a Basket of Pippins, which he had brought him for a Present, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him to give him the Living, which was in his Gift; his Lordship sent the Parson his Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket of Pippins again, and also sent word, that the Living was not a Pippin matter, and that he had as good Pippins growing in his own Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard. Well, the Parson, (upon giving the Servant a Pippin,) prevails with him to carry the Basket of Pippins a Second time to his Lordship, with this Request, that his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship would Cut one of the Pippins, for he did not believe his Lordship had so good Pip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pins growing in his Orchard. Upon this, his Lordship Cuts one of the Pippins, and finds it to be a Golden Pippin; then he presently causes his Servant to call in the Parson, and bids him very welcome, and tells him, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of the Basket of Pippins, and the Living was his, and withal told him, if all the Trees in his Orchard bore such Pippins, they would do him more good than all St.</hi> Paul<hi>'s Learning.</hi> This Sin of <hi>Bribery</hi> doth not only Reign in King's Palaces, but, like the Leprosie, spreads it self in all the <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Equity</hi> and <hi>Justice,</hi> even to the meanest in Office. When I was a Boy I heard this following Story of that Great and Learned Man, the Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> who was Lord Chancellor in King <hi>James</hi> the First Reign, I would speak tenderly of him, because he was one
<pb facs="tcp:205150:17"/>of the Learnedest Men of his Age; I will tell the Natural Story, and leave the <hi>Reader</hi> to his own thoughts, Much at the time he was p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>t out of the Chancellorship, he happen'd to come into his Hall where his Gentlemen were at Dinner. As soon as they see my Lord, they all rose up, but his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship calls to them to sit still, <hi>For,</hi> saith he, <hi>your Rise has been my Fall.</hi> But the Story I aim at, is this, About the Year <hi>1655,</hi> some Gentlemen meeting in my Master's Shop, (a Bookseller,) and talking of Learning, and Learned Men, they men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> to be one of the Learnedest Men of the World, in the Age he liv'd in, but one of the Gentlemen, who by his Gray-head could not be less than Seventy Years of Age, Reply'd, <hi>He did agree with them in their Opinion of my Lord</hi> Bacon, <hi>but my Lord had a Fault, whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it was he could not tell, but,</hi> saith he, <hi>I my self having some Business with his Lordship, I went to him to his Countrey-House, which was near St.</hi> Albons, <hi>Twenty Miles from</hi> London, <hi>where I was Admitted into his Study, where was no person but his Lordship and my self, and whilst I was talking with him about my Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, his Lordship had occasion to Ease Nature, and withdrew out of his Study, and left me there alone; whilst his Lordship was gone, there came into the Study, one of his Lordships Gentlemen, and opens my Lord's Chest of Drawers wherein his Money was, and takes it out in Handfuls and fills both his Pockets, and goes away without saying one word to me; he was no sooner gone, but comes a Second
<pb facs="tcp:205150:17"/>Gentleman, opens the same Drawers, fills both his Pockets with Money, and goes away as the former did, without speaking one word to me; at which I was surpris'd, and much concern'd, and was resolv'd to Acquaint my Lord with it. As soon as my Lord return'd into his Study, I told him,</hi> my Lord, <hi>here was a very odd pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage happen'd, since your Lordship went to Ease your self; upon which he ask'd me what it was, I told the passage as here related. He shook his Head, and all that he said was, Sir, I cannot help my self. Reader,</hi> give me leave to divert thee with a Story or Two more on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of <hi>Bribery,</hi> About the Year <hi>1642,</hi> when that unhappy Difference between King <hi>Charles</hi> the First, and his <hi>Parliament,</hi> made, (as on all Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions is usually done,) such great Alterations in the Government, by turning out and putting in Men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Places and Offices; Among other Officers, the Two <hi>Secondaries</hi> of the <hi>Counter-Prisons</hi> in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> were turn'd out, upon which the then Shiriffs of <hi>London</hi> sent for one of the <hi>Secondaries</hi> Clerks, whose Name was Mr. <hi>Richard Smith,</hi> (a person well known to most of the Eminent Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> who himself told me this Sttory,) and Ask'd him. <hi>Whether he would Accept of the</hi> Secondary<hi>'s Office? He told them he would, if he might have his Choice of the</hi> Counters, <hi>the which they easily granted him, and he wav'd the</hi> Counter <hi>he was brought up a Clerk in, and made Choice of the other. As soon as he was fix'd in, one comes to him and tells him, Sir, you must present the Sheriff with a Bag of
<pb facs="tcp:205150:18"/>Gold, for it is expected from you. No Sir,</hi> said he, <hi>not I, I will not give him one Farthing. Then Sir,</hi> saith that person, <hi>you must present him with a Cubbard of Plate. No Sir,</hi> said Mr. <hi>Smith, not I. Then Sir,</hi> said he, <hi>you must give the Sheriff a Coach and Horses, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise you will be turn'd out of your Office of</hi> Secondary. <hi>He Answered him again, Sir, I Value not that, I will not give the Sheriff one Farthing, neither directly, nor indirectly, for if I do, its against the Law, and I shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by forfit my place; and I would at any time chuse to be turn'd out of my place, then forfit it by doing an Act contrary to Law.</hi> So he kept it many Years, till he grew very Old, and then parted with it. This place is now Sold, if I am truly inform'd, for <hi>1500 l.</hi> if not Two Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Pounds. And I am told by one that was an intimate Acquaintance of Sir <hi>Robert Viner,</hi> who had been Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> that when he took his Oath, he was Sworn not to sell any Place, or Places. But this the great Citizens of <hi>London</hi> know best: I only tell my <hi>Reader</hi> what I am inform'd, and that I have good Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for what I say; but this I do Aver for a Truth, <hi>That if any Man Buys, or Sells, any Place, or Office, for which he is not Impower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Law to do, its plain</hi> Bribery. If it be a <hi>Prison-Keepers-Place,</hi> the Crime is the greater, because the Buyer is under a strong Temptation of <hi>Oppression</hi> and <hi>Extortion,</hi> and be thinks himself put upon a Necessity of Grinding the Face of the poor, to get up his Principal Moneys again. And
<pb facs="tcp:205150:18"/>then again, <hi>Reader.</hi> it's a usual saying amonst Men, such and such places are very good places, and they are worth so many Hundred or Thousand Pounds <hi>per Annum Salery,</hi> besides the <hi>Perquisites,</hi> which may be worth as much more: Now I must tell thee, <hi>Reader,</hi> we say in Trade, That the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery</hi> of a Trade is generally taken for the Knavish part of the Trade; so <hi>Perquisites</hi> in <hi>Places</hi> and <hi>Offi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>es,</hi> are the <hi>Bribes</hi> given and taken by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties concerned. As for Example, what should move a <hi>Merchant</hi> to give a <hi>Custom-House-Man</hi> five or ten Guineas more than he knows is his just due, but that he might Cheat Their <hi>Majesties</hi> of Their <hi>Customs,</hi> which he knows is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THE Relicks of Good Nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in Man since the Fall, have taught Heathens to know and practice many Noble Vertues: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the rest, some of them have abounded in a most Affectionate Love to their Country, the Welfare and Happiness of which they have preferred before their own Lives: Many Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings have they wrote to this purpose, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>Cicero,</hi> in his Book of <hi>Scipio</hi>'s Dream, where he brings in a Dead Father, (now in Heaven) encouraging his Son to doe his Country Service, wherein himself had given him a Noble Example, with this Sentence, <hi>There is a most sure and certain place in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for every Man that shall procure the Weal of his Country, either by freeing it from Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, or any way increasing its Happiness.</hi> That for which I quote this Sentence out of <hi>Cicero</hi> is, To shew how Reason doth tell us Christians, how careful we should be of our Countreys Welfare, to preserve it from Oppressions, and to Augment the Flourishing Estate thereof. Those that stand in Places of Honour and Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:205150:23"/>may perform many Noble and Heroick Services for the Good and Prosperity of their Countrey, but we that are poor Shrubs, that sit in Shades below, in Prisons, nay in Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, can do nothing but Pray for the Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Welfare of our <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> and also not only Lament for the Oppressions and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortions that we the poor Miserable of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation Groan under, but also discover to the World those Wicked Oppressors, and the Ways and Means they use to Oppress even we the Oppressed; which Ways are so dark, and have been so long hidden from the Eyes of the great Men of the World, that live in Ease, Prosperity and Splendor, that it's a very hard matter to make them believe those Tragedies that are Acted in Prisons, on we the poor Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned Debtors, and if they should be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded of the truth of them, yet they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves being free from them, and think they are in no danger of falling into them, are like <hi>Gains, That Care not for any of these Matters.</hi> The great encrease of Swarms of Wicked Men, and their Oppressions, do assure us, that there is a Righteous Judg in Heaven, who from thence beholds all the Oppressions of the Sons of Men, and will not long forbear to Scourge the Oppressors. There was never any Nation under Heaven that has had more Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances from Popish Tyranny and Oppression, than we, and shall we notwithstanding enter into a Contention with the Almighty, whether He shall be more Merciful, or we more Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> We Humbly Complain, That the said <hi>Gaoler</hi> does keep Correspondence with Felons, and suffered one <hi>Robert Slinger,</hi> a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Convicted Felon, to be his Bully, and to revenge his Quarrel against one <hi>Stephen Turrington,</hi> a poor Debtor, and to Wound the said <hi>Turrington,</hi> and almost to knock out one of his Eyes, whereby the said <hi>Turrington</hi> was much abus'd; and when he complain'd to <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Smith</hi> the <hi>Gaoler,</hi> he was entertain'd with nothing but Scoffs and Laughter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We Humbly Complain, That the said <hi>Gaoler</hi> suffers the Felons usually to go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetterd, and after Conviction to frequent the Town upon any occasion; and by giving so much liberty, suffers many to escape, and to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:205150:28"/>abuse the liberty granted them, to the great prejudice of the poor Debtors; as particularly, by granting the like liberty to one <hi>Robert Keale</hi> a Notorious Felon, being Three times Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed; he the said <hi>Keale</hi> Rob'd the Chest, or Box, of one <hi>Ruth Bollan,</hi> a poor Debtor, and pilfred from her the Summ of Forty Shillings, which she the said <hi>Ruth</hi> had by her Industry collected, during her Six Years Imprisonment, intending, after her enlargement, that the said Summ should part of it defray her Charges, and the remainder Buy her a little stock of Wool wherewith to employ her self for a poor Livelihood; which Loss, when she the said <hi>Ruth</hi> complained of, threatning an Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against the said <hi>Keale</hi> the next Assizes, the said <hi>Keale</hi> was suffered to escape, and the said <hi>Ruth</hi> forc'd to rest content with loss of her Money, the <hi>Gaoler</hi> only telling her, she should have look'd to it better.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We Humbly Complain, That the said <hi>William Smith</hi> will not suffer us the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed Prisoners to send for any Ale, or Beer, out of Prison, whereas he the said <hi>Smith</hi> does not allow half Measure that others give, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so what he does vend, is so Base, Muddy, and Unwholesome, that it rather Infects than Nourishes; his <hi>Tapster,</hi> (a Fellow formerly of the Iron-Regiment,) making the Floatings of the sediment of Dregs with his Beer for poor Prisoners; besides, if any poor Prisoner calls to <hi>Claxtons,</hi> at the Castle-Gates, for a Penny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth of what is wholesome and refreshing,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:205150:28"/>the said <hi>Smith</hi> Storms and Frowns, threatning to break their Vessels, and as he calls it, to come even with those that go not to his Spung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cellar.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> We Humbly Complain, That whereas the said <hi>Smith</hi> has allowed him from the several Wapentakes of the County, the Summ of Sixty, or Seventy Pounds <hi>per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> which is paid him by the Chief-Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels at every Quarter Sessions, for the Support and Relief of poor Prisoners for Allowance of Bread, and if that Summ will not satisfie, may, upon Complaint, have more; yet he the said <hi>Smith</hi> converts the said Moneys to his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per use, and the poor Debtors have no Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance as was ordered for them, under the Hands of the Justices of the Peace; and he the said <hi>Smith</hi> gives Churlish Answers when it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, so that the Prisoners are Injured, and so far suppressed from Craving it, that several have Perished for want of Food and Order; when as this very Allowance, as may be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, would as yet have preserv'd them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, and with what they would have wrought for, have Relieved them, and restored them to Health, whereas some lately Died meerly with Hunger, and want of Order.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> We Humbly Complain, That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as here be several of us of good Credit, and have been formerly of Repute in the World, and are still, (excepting what the Necessities of our Confinement brings upon us,) and have lived in Plenty, having good Order, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:205150:29"/>Conveniencies; yet now that we are in <hi>Gaol</hi> we find our selves by the unworthy Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our <hi>Gaoler</hi> horridly abused, he exacting of us for Chamber-Rent and Bedding, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that if we comply not with his Demands, to turn us down into a stinking Cave; not fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for Persons whose Extraction is Laudable, and Education is Ingenious; whereas we the said Prisoners are willing to allow what is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Statute in that case provided; as also that we may have our own Linnen and Bedding, and not be confin'd to the <hi>Gaoler</hi>'s Furniture, which is more fit Litter for Hoggs, than Bedding for Men, the Chambers not se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing us from Wind and Weather.</p>
                     <p>We Humbly Complain, That whereas many, or most of us, are Miserably Poor, wanting all manner of Necessaries, having not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of Craving Charity, by reason of the remoteness of our Prison from the Town; and whereas we crav'd leave of our <hi>Gaoler</hi> for Two whom we could trust to go into the Town with a Petition, to pray some Assistance from good People, whereby we might either pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure our Enlargement, or if not that, yet at least our present Support; and whereas for one part of a Day our <hi>Gaoler</hi> did admit of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, yet immediately, out of a Morose and Peevish Humour, he refus'd, so that many of us are totally destitute of succour, being treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed worse than Gally-Slaves, and much more Indigent than the poorest Mendicant.</p>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:205150:29"/>
                     <p>We Humbly Complain, That whereas it has been the Custom of this <hi>Gaol,</hi> that those that lay in the upper Chambers, in the Coldness of the Winter-Season, have had the liberty of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess to the Kitchin-Fire till Nine of the Clock at Night, whereby they were greatly enliven'd and cherish'd; yet now the <hi>Gaoler</hi> takes that Priviledg from them, and neither will suffer them to come there, nor allow any publick place in the Prison for the conveniency of the Prisoner, nor admit them to have liberty after Locking up, to bring any Victuals when warm, nor liberty to ease Nature, whereby the Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners do oftentimes become Offensive to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. These, with many other things of the like Nature, will be Justified upon occasion; so, that if this be made Publick, we desire that no Name be made use of till it comes to the Test. This from your humble Servant,</p>

Our Grievances are great, our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement is very close, we have not any Yard to walk in, here are Seven of us that have not walk'd this Six or Seven Years in any place to take the Air, for it's not allow'd us; here is a large Room in our Prison which is common for all Prisoners to walk there, but it's at the Keeper's pleasure; us he Confines in a Room which is not above Eighteen Foot and some Inches Square, in which we are close Confin'd Day and Night, also here is a House of Office in it, which Ten or Twelve Men do Ease themselves in, so we that are close Confin'd do such the ill Air that doth proceed from their Excrements, and the Nastiness of the House
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:205150:36"/>of Office, so that we are suffocated with ill Air, which makes us very Sick, and are broken out with <hi>Boils, Carbunckles,</hi> and <hi>Botches;</hi> we are kept without any Water for Weeks toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Those of us that can get Moneys to spend, or cause others to spend, may walk in the common Room, but still by Night are Lock'd up Ten, Twelve, sometimes Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, in the said Room of Eighteen Foot and some Inches, in which is but one Light, which is not above two Foot Square, which looks out into the common Goal where Criminals are kept, sometimes Ten, or Twelve of them all in a Room of the same dimensions of ours, which with the Air that doth proceed from their Room and House of Office, and our House of Office, doth quite take away our Breath.

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:205150:41"/>they Stole, upon and in the Company of the said Gaoler. Further, There is a Garden bought for the Prisoners to take the Air, and Walk in; all other Gaolers before him kept a Lad to see to the Prisoners whilst they walk'd there, which was done with safety to the Gaoler, and Comfort and Health to the Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; but now the present Gaoler suffers no Prisoner but whom he pleases, and when he pleases, and only such as will spend their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys on him to make him Drunk; and also when any Prisoners are discharged, he the said Gaoler keeps and detains them for most strange, unmerciful, exacting Fees, and by that forceth many poor Debtors to pawn, sell, or leave behind them, their Cloths from off their Backs, contrary to the Statutes and Laws of this Land. Also if any Gift come to the poor Debtors from any Charitable well disposed People; if it be Victuals, then he Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the best of it for his own Family, and for the rest he causes to be given to those that Lodg in his own Chambers, and spend what they have with, and on him, he having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by endangered the Starving of several Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:205150:42"/>Gaol from the Debtora several Years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which said Rooms Debtors have formerly enjoyed, but Persons that have been Condemned for High-Treason, have been permitted by the said Gaoler, for some extraordinary benefit to himself, to have the use of those Rooms, which said Persons by the Act of Parliament ought not to come among Debtors; and the want of these Rooms hath been very prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to the poor Debtors, in respect of their Health, and hereby also they are in great danger of Diseases to breed among them by the Noisome smell that is occasioned by the Croud; and when the Weather is Cold, half of the poor Debtors cannot come to the Fire to get their Meat drest, and are almost star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. And the Keeper doth say, That if Three Hundred Prisoners come, they shall have no more Room. The Debtors do humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, That it will be judged very reasonable, that such Persons, who, by the Act of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, ought not to come amongst Debtors, should have the use of those Rooms, and that the Debtors, for whom they were built, and who have also contributed towards the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, should not enjoy them. And for want of these Rooms many have been forced to Lodg in the Gaoler's House, which is above Twenty Pound a Year Charge for Diet, besides other Expences which cannot be avoided; which hath been in a great measure to the Ruin of many persons, and hath made them uncapable of paying their Debts, which
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:205150:43"/>otherwise might be prevented. Several other Abuses the Debtors have received from their Keeper, and his Turn-Key <hi>Joseph Sherwin,</hi> as upon a Complaint made, by us poor Debtors, to <hi>John Barrow</hi> Esq; and â€” <hi>Finney</hi> Esq; in both their Years of High-Sheriff, hoping to be relieved by them under these Abuses; our Keeper <hi>William Wragg</hi> hearing of it was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Angry with us the poor Debtors, and caused us to be Lock'd up in our Rooms for several Nights together, which was not done before; so that when we had occasion to go to the House of Office to Ease our selves we could not, neither could we have any thing brought us to Comfort our selves when we were not well. And also he threatned one <hi>John Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> who wrote the Complaints to the said High Sheriffs, who was then, and is now, a Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that he would make him swallow his Knife. Also when the poor Debtors have no Money, and cannot be Trusted by the Keeper for a little Ale when they are not well, he hath refused to let them have it where they might be Trusted, and also have more for their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. And further, When People come to bring any of us Work, whereby we may get an honest Penny towards our Relief, and also when any come to bring us Victuals, the Turn-Key will not suffer them to stay to pay or receive Money for what they bring; and if they be not just ready to come when he calls, he Curseth them, and calls them Whores, and Salt Bitches, so that they are unwilling to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:205150:43"/>bring us either Meat, Drink, or Work. As whereas we the poor Debtors do usually Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the County, for the Charity of all well disposed People, for something towards our Relief against the good time commonly called <hi>Christmas;</hi> and tho' we are at the Charge of sending Persons to Collect the same, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding our Keeper will suffer none to go to Collect it, but some particular persons, who have been Five or Six Years in his Custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and to whom he hath shewed Kindness above others, by granting them Liberty to be at home almost all the time of their Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and for this Kindness shewed to them, they are afraid to displease their Keeper in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering his Desires, which is to give the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney they have Collected into his, or his Wifes Hands, which they have usually done; and hereby we have been Defrauded of a great part of our Money which hath been given. At <hi>Christmas</hi> was Two Years there was gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Collectors confession, between Eight and Nine Pounds, and we the poor Debtors had not above Four Pounds of it, neither would our Keeper ever since give us an Account of the rest, altho' we have several times de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it, and have also charged him openly with Cheating of us. Likewise, about Two Years since, The Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>Devonshire</hi> gave us the poor Debtors Five Pounds, which would have been to every one of us Five or Six Shillings, had it been ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly disposed of, but we had but Two Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:205150:44"/>and Half a Crown a piece. Several other Gentlemen have given to us poor Debtors, and we have been abus'd in the like manner. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise our Keeper has a Prejudice against some of us the poor Debtors, for declaring these his Abuses to his Face, for which reason he hath caused the Countrey-Allowance to be taken from some of us, but upon our Complaint to our Justices it was allowed to us again. Also <hi>Elizabeth Hardey,</hi> a Prisoner, received her Allowance of Bread, which was a Four Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Loaf, and that Day the Bread was deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, after she had Eaten some of it, was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from her Actions, the <hi>Turnkey</hi> came immediately and took the remaining part of the Loaf from her. <hi>Winefrid Buxton</hi> Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, Aged Seventy, a Prisoner almost Four Years, the same Day she had her discharge from her Creditor, the Keeper took her Allowance of Bread from her, and she continued a Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner above a Fortnight after, because she could not have her discharge from the <hi>Sheriff,</hi> and so lost her Bread for that time; and this the Keeper did, because she refused to pay those unjust Fees which he demanded. Several others have been abused by paying undue Fees. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise we the poor Prisoners have been abused by our Keepers putting his <hi>Swine</hi> amongst us, Four or Six at a time, for several Days and Nights together, when the Water has come into his Yard, and thereby we have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Choaked, and could not open our Doors <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>But we Humbly Pray, That the Parliament, or at least the Judges, will be moved with Pity and Compassion to look upon our Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Condition. And as the County, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with our selves, (tho' now in a low Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,) have been at the Charge to build a new <hi>Gaol</hi> for poor Debtors, and on which, (under God,) our Health, whilst in durance, doth much depend, so likewise we may enjoy the Privileges we have paid for; and that an end may be put to the <hi>Gaoler</hi>'s Arbitrary Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, hoping that our Confinement will be thought to be sufficient punishment for that which was not, nor is not, in our power to help, without this Cruelty and Oppression added to it. And that there may be a Table of Fees, and of the Gifts that Benefactors have or shall bestow upon, and to the said <hi>Gaol,</hi> for the release of poor Prisoners, and that it may be set up in the said County-Gaol, where all Prisoners may see their Charge, and that the Chamber-Rent may be settled accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Statute made in the Twenty Second, and Twenty Third Years of <hi>Charles</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of Blessed Memory, so that we may En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy so much of the Liberty as is there set forth, and we the poor Prisoners for Debt, shall ever Bless God, and them for it.

Sir, I am in several other Debts, and several poor Men are like to be Ruined by my Unjust detainment in Prison. All the Thatch is blown off my House, my Wife and Children are almost starved, my Trade is clearly laid aside, my

And there are unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Fees taken by our Gaoler, <hi>Jonathan Wilson,</hi> of us the poor Prisoners; one <hi>James Stephenson</hi> paid for his Fees Fifty Shillings for fome Three Weeks time upon a Writ, and after his Adversary had discharg'd him, he the said <hi>Wilson</hi> kept him Two or Three Days till he made him pay the said Summ. Also one <hi>Isaac Ingham,</hi> for a bare Writ, and Three Days Imprisonment, the Gaoler made him pay Forty Five Shillings. And one <hi>James Haye</hi> Arrested on a <hi>Proprium</hi> for Ten Shillings Debt, and he was in Prison but Two Days, the Gao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:205150:49"/>took Thirty Shillings Fees of him; besides, they took his Horse from him, and Rode up and down on him, and when he got out of Prison, he was forced to seek his Horse where he could find him. And also one <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Capon</hi> was Arrested for Fourteen Pence Debr, he was held to Bail for Ten Pounds in the Writ, paid the Gaoler for his Fees Thirty Shillings, besides Four of his Children at two times were brought to Prison, and holden to Bail, being some of them but Thirteen, or Fourteen Years of Age, one of them was for Words, another of them for a Debt of Ten Shillings. Also one <hi>Jonas Smith</hi> was Arrested in Execution for a Debt of Twelve Pounds, and he paid into the Gaoler's Hands Thirty Two Pounds, which was paid into the Gaoler's Hands of the same Man's Moneys, by order of Law, and another Suit, and he ordered the Gaoler to pay the Twelve Pounds he lay for, and he was Released, and the Gaoler turn'd him out of Prison. Afterwards the said <hi>Smith</hi> goes to the Gaoler, and demands the rest of his Moneys, and to come to Account with him the said <hi>Smith,</hi> upon which the said Gao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler takes up the said <hi>Jonas Smith</hi> with the same Execution, and puts him in the low Gaol, and there he the said <hi>Jonas Smith</hi> remains to this Day; and the said <hi>Smith</hi>'s Money is still in the said Gaoler's Hands, and the said Gaoler re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseth to give the said <hi>Smith</hi> any Account of it. The Keeper has taken Thirty Garnishes, Two Shillings and Eight Pence each Garnish,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:205150:49"/>and keeps the Money, and will not give the poor Prisoners the Drink due to them for that Money, besides he keeps other Moneys which is given to the Prisoners, and thereby wrongs them, besides many other Abuses he puts on us the poor Prisoners. It's a Prison not fit to be kept, except it be to <hi>Clam,</hi> that is to starve poor Men to Death, for there is no Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance at all belonging to it. There is an Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in <hi>Hallifax,</hi> â€” who brings most of these unlawful Writs that throws poor Men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Prison, where they are like to be starv'd to Death, and binds Men that he brings the Writs for, that they shall not agree with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Consent. And likewise one <hi>JOHN GREGSON,</hi> an Attorney, hath Five poor Prisoners in this Gaol, under pretence of Debt, and they owe him nothing; some have been Eleven, some Five, others Four Years Prisoners at his Suit; he hath been a great destroyer of many Families. Besides all these Abuses, there is to mention one given by <hi>Joshua Wilson</hi> the Turn-Key, to <hi>David Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> upon the Eleventh of <hi>June,</hi> 1690, who did Wilfully and Violently Beat-the said <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> a Prisoner, whom he hurried to the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Door, and threw him down a pair of Stone-stairs of Ten Steps backward, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he caused one <hi>Thomas Milner</hi> to throw him over the Threshold of the Door into the lower Gaol; and afterwards the said <hi>Milner,</hi> by Order of the Turn-Key, did throw him down on the Prison-floor, so that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:205150:50"/>by Beating and Brusing him the said <hi>Claton,</hi> he was not able to stand, nor do any thing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Livelihood, but hath been in great danger of losing his Life ever since by that Abuse. All which Grievances we can prove on Oath.</p>

                     <p>THE Gaol in the County of <hi>Devon</hi> is kept at <hi>Stock,</hi> above Three Miles from any Town, in a small Village; The House is very small for such a Number of Men and Women as are there; the Gaoler puts Three or Four Beds in a Chamber, and Three Persons in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry narrow Bed, that they have not room to turn themselves; every particular Person pays Two Shillings Six Pence <hi>per</hi> Week, so that their Chambers are Twice as dear as any in the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> or <hi>Fleet.</hi> Besides the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery of being so throng'd, there is not nigh as much room in the Chambers as the Beds take up. The Prisoners have been denyed their Victuals to be brought into the House, and their Landresses was kept out for a Month, that the Prisoners were forc'd to put all things out of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:205150:50"/>the Window. There is no other Drink al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed but Ale, of Six, Eight, and Ten Days old; the Gaoler sells it to the Tapster for For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Three Shillings <hi>per</hi> Hogshead, and the Tap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster will-sell little more than a Pint for Two Pence, which we can have stronger from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad for One Penny, but the Prisoners dare not send for it if the Keeper be in the way, nor have it brought in at the Door, but put into them at the Windows in small quantities. Several have Perished for want; one <hi>Fursden</hi> was starv'd to Death, according to the Return the Jury was to give to the Coronor, one Mr. <hi>Wills,</hi> who did not make a due Return of the said <hi>Fursden,</hi> as of others. And also <hi>David Hart,</hi> and <hi>John Soaper,</hi> were put in Irons for no other reason, but because they put their Names as Witnesses to an Indictment against <hi>Alexander Symons</hi> the Keeper, for Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of a Prisoner in <hi>November,</hi> 1688, that he kept the said <hi>Hart</hi> so long in Irons, that it had like to have cost him his Life; the said Keeper is a Butcher by Trade, and keeps Twenty or Thirty Hogs in a Court, within Twenty Foot of the Kitchin-Door. The Keeper frequently intercepts the Prisoners Letters, and either burns them, or throws them into the River, that they are forc'd to send all their Letters of Concernment by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Hands, which costs the Prisoners above Ten Pounds <hi>per Annum;</hi> that they have but one House of Office for nigh Seventy People, and that is uncover'd, and is very Noisome, as
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:205150:51"/>is the House and Yard, being low and level; so that strangers complain when they come, it almost takes away their Breath. To all these particulars I am ready to make Oath.</p>

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:205150:51"/>our Liberty. Besides, the said <hi>King</hi> threatens to Iron us, as he hath done before, and saith, he will do the like to those that do Complain. And the said <hi>King</hi> doth demand Six Shillings, and Seven Shillings, a Week of Prisoners Lodging on Flock-Beds, and doth refuse to give us any Table of Fees, or let us see what they are, according to the Statute, but doth Rule us by an Arbitrary Power. The Tapster saith, he cannot afford more than Three Pints of middle Beer for Six Pence, which he sells us for best Beer, because he pays the Keeper Thirty Five Shillings a Barrel, and sometimes the Keeper refuseth to let us come to the Pump for Water. He keeps back out of every Shillings-worth of Shire-Bread which the County allows us, Two Pence in the Shilling. He makes us pay Two Shillings for the Copy of every Warrant we are Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned upon. He makes us pay Ten or Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Shillings for the Garnish of every Man that is Committed to his Prison, and Six Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and Eight Pence the Commitment-Fee upon every Action upon every Person. Last Night we sent for a poor Man to carry out some Letters to the Post-House, for <hi>London,</hi> and other places, and he was kept Prisoner all Night, to our great damage. In tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, we do most humbly beseech you, to take our Deplorable Condition into your most serious Consideration, and Order us speedy Relief, and we shall be for ever bound, as in Duty, to Pray. <hi>William Shermon, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Rose, John Cullum,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

Last <hi>Saturday</hi> Night, when we were going to be Lock'd up in the Tower, where we have neither Beds nor Straw to Lodg on, its a place worse than the Dungeon, we are but Seven Hours of the Twenty Four out of it; I had sent a Woman, who is a Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the Prison, for Provision my Friends had sent me, she not bringing of it me so soon as she might have done, and I almost starved, was forced to speak, and speaking to some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prisoners as stood just by, I said to them, <hi>What an old Bitch she was, she could not bring it before I were Lock'd up in the Tower.</hi> As soon as I spoke, she knock'd at the Gate, then Answer was made me by the Nurse, (a Deve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Woman, who has always been Malitious to me,) <hi>That the old Bitch was come,</hi> then presently Mistress <hi>Thorp,</hi> the Prison-Keeper, came to me, and caused me to have Irons, and a great piece of Wood, as big as any Mans

This is all the Affront was given, I have several Prisoners to Justifie it; but the greatest reason was, as I believe, my having received Letters from you, giving us an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the proceedings of the Parliament, as to the Act for Release of poor Imprisoned Debtors, for the other matter was not cause enough to Iron and Clog me. She knows, and is sensible, that I have no Friend to stand by me, and that makes her the bolder. A Man had better be subject to Slavery, than to this Woman, for she is a Devil. Pray in your next satisfie me what I can do in it, I have sent to the Under-Sheriff, and can have no Redress, had I best Petition the Parliament. Sir, I beg of you give me the best directions you can in it. I have not lain in a Bed since the Third of <hi>April</hi> last, and she forces others to pay a Groat a Night for Lodging in a Lowfie Flock-Bed.

                     <p>THE Letter we received last <hi>Thursday</hi> Morning from you, had inevitably like to have been seized on to be read by Mrs. <hi>Thorp,</hi> Mistress of the Prison. So soon as I heard the Post-Man was come, I hastened to him, and told him, that if so be he delivered the Letter to any but me, I would acquaint the Post-Master-General with it; but the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress of the <hi>Gaol</hi> reply'd, that she was afraid there might be Treason in it; that excuse she made only, because she had Iron'd me, and therefore she pretended to stretch her power further out, (thinking, that as Souls in Hell could have no Redemption, so she thinks 'tis the same with me, being here a long time, and no Friend,) then she gave Orders to the Post-Man to carry the Letter back, because I told him I had not to pay for it, that was my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, that she should not see in; then she gave Orders, that when-ever I sent for it, she would see it, and if there was not Treason in the Letter, she would take off my Iron and Wood, but she knew from whence it came, and had a
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:205150:54"/>mind to see the News, but I very privately got the Letter unknown to her, but upon my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising her that she shall see the Letter, she has taken off the Irons and Wooden-Clog; 'tis supposed the Sheriff Check'd her. Sir, Here are some other Prisoners that are in a prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterous manner hindred from the conveniency of sending for small Drink out of Prison; the place they use to send for it is Lock'd up, and they cannot have a Messenger for their Moneys to do any thing for them, they are forced to drink Water when they cannot find Two Pence to pay for a Flaggon of Drink, and in the next place are forc'd to Lodg on a Flock-Bed, and to pay Half a Crown a Week; this is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of one <hi>John Staytt,</hi> who is in a very poor Condition, and was forced to Tick in the Celler at his first coming; they have run him up Six Pounds, and he will take his Oath, he never ow'd them Five, (I never knew any Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner that ever Tick'd but paid Four Pence for a Flaggon of Drink,) he now remains Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner for Three Pounds due to the Celler, and has been so Six Months; this <hi>John Staytt</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to Lie in the Tower, or Dungeon, that so he might be Rent-free, but the Mistress of the Prison replyed thus, <hi>No Man should go there,</hi> and pretended she was to keep him safe, and so forces him to that vast Expence of a Bed, that so poor Man he may continue a Prisoner all his Life time, for the Rent of his Lodging, and Celler-Score, if not forgiven by this most gratious Act we are in expectation
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:205150:55"/>of. Here is also one <hi>William Surgeant,</hi> a Man that has been here a considerable while, that has also been Damnified by the People of the Prison; he told Mrs. <hi>Thorp,</hi> when I was thrust out of my Lodging, that he desired Free Quarters; she knowing him to have an Estate, told him, <hi>He should tarry where he was put, or ordered.</hi> Then he Resolving not to be at that vast Expence, sent for a Bed, and other Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, of his own; when she saw them brought into the Castle, (which she could not deny,) she ordered him to lie in a place called <hi>Smithfield,</hi> and denied him Free Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. And some time after this my self, and some others, being ordered to be put in the Tower, he desiring also to go with us with his Bed, (in Charity somewhat towards us,) he was by Mistress <hi>Thorp</hi> denied, and was forc'd there to remain, although he demanded seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times to Lie in Free Quarters on his own Bed, telling of her, <hi>He would pay nothing for his Lodging;</hi> and Mistress <hi>Thorp</hi> knowing he intended the beginning of this Term to <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sede</hi> his Actions, and he having the Copeys of his Warrants, she told him, <hi>That if so be he would not pay her Eighteen Pence a Week for the time he had lain out of her Bed, she would send to his Creditors, and cause his</hi> Superseding <hi>to be stop'd.</hi> Upon which he was forced to give a Note under his Hand for the payment of so much Moneys as she demanded, that so he might have his Liberty at the end of the Term. Here is also one <hi>Richard Inon,</hi> a Man of good
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:205150:55"/>Repute, has been a considerable while in Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stody, he has also Tick'd in the Celler, he is likewise Defrauded, or Misreckoned, of Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Shillings in his Accouns, and was about a Month since turn'd out of his Bed into the Tower to me, and staid there a Fortnight, and was then wheadled to his Bed again, but still she Duns him for Moneys for his Lodging at Seven Groats a Week. He told her, <hi>It was not reasonable to pay Four Pence a Night for a Bed of Flocks, and that he would pay her Two Pence a Night, which was sufficient, and he would give her no more;</hi> giving her Son, (who is an Attorney,) Orders to receive so much Moneys of a Friend of his. She told him, <hi>He should not only pay Four Pence a Night for his Bed, but also Six Pence a Week for his Lodging in the Tower on the Boards,</hi> for she will not suffer us to bring into the Tower either Beds, or Straw. This Mr. <hi>Inon</hi> has been very ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to Mistress <hi>Thorp,</hi> in Working several Days a Quilting for her, finding her Materials also; all which she expects he should do for her for nothing. The second Night he was put into the Tower with me, he was intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Abus'd by the Turn-Key, and his Boy; he was Knock'd down, they giving him Black Eyes, and a Mauld Face, which was insuffera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Spectators, but no one durst resist. This is our sad Condition, and rather worse, but we want Words to express our Misery in this our Imprisonment, we are your Servants. <hi>Tho. Hill, Will. Surgeans, J. Staytt, Rich. Inon,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Nov.</hi> 13. 1690.</p>

                     <p>I Received yours of the Twenty First, which was broke up by one <hi>James Hunt,</hi> who is a Debtor, and the Keeper's Tapster, so that we had like to have miss'd of the same; and many that are in the Keeper's Debt, are by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of that Letter in a Panick Fear of being Committed to the Wards. You Write, that if we have any Abuses from our Gaoler, to let you have a true Account of the same. Now to speak of all the Abuses I and others have met withal, the Keeper's Cruelty is so great, I cannot declare the same at present, without Tears in my Eyes, which Mrs. <hi>Payne,</hi> now a Prisoner in the <hi>Fleet,</hi> was an Eye-Witness to a great part thereof. I was Committed to the Prison the 30th of <hi>September,</hi> 1689, and held to Bail for an Action of Trespass upon a Lease that I took of a piece of ground. I made Oath, That I did not owe the Plaintiff Five Pound upon Bill, Bond, or any Account. Then the Plaintiff Replied, I owed the said Plaintiff Ten Pound; and so I rested till the Twenty Second of <hi>February,</hi> then I sent to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:205150:57"/>my Attorney for a <hi>Seupersedeas,</hi> with directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Keeper should give me the Copy of my Warrant, with a Certificate, that there was no other Warrants against me: But the said Keeper denied the same: And then I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the same of the Steward of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of <hi>Bury St. Edmond,</hi> he gave me a lame Answer, <hi>That his Writs were then gone to</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. So that here I must Lie for ever, <hi>If Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief come not some other way,</hi> as <hi>Mordeca</hi> said to <hi>Ester:</hi> For the Cruelty of the Keeper is so great an Oppression, that we can have as much good and wholsome Beer from the <hi>Bushel-End</hi> for Six Pence, as is Sold in the Gaol for Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Pence. And to prevent the taking in of Beer at the Windows, the said Keeper caused new Bars to be set up thicker, that now we cannot take in any thing but at the Door, which is opened but when they please. Then I told the Keeper, or Under-Keeper, that in the 22d, and 23d, of <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, there passed an Act for the Liberty of the Prisoners of <hi>England, That Prisoners might send for Beer, and all manner of Necessaries, when and where they would.</hi> Upon this they put me into the Inward Prison, or Ward, Five Foot within the ground, on the 25th of <hi>December</hi> last, wherein I saw no Sun for the space of Eight Weeks. Then I Petitioned the Judg at the <hi>Lent</hi> Assize, but when my Petition was Read, the Judg Commanded the Gaoler, or Under-Keeper, to bring me down to Depose the same; but I was Wheadled off by the Turn-Key till
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:205150:58"/>the Judg was out of Town, and then when they had almost Foundered me with Lodging in a little Straw, and well near Poisoned me with Noisome Scents, that I broke out with Boils, and Lameness. I then had some Rest, and walked in the Yard, till about <hi>June,</hi> and then hearing that my Adversary was Dead, demanded my Liberty; then I was shut up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and there lay in the fame Ward in Straw, and have had no Provision, or other Necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, sometimes, but what is delivered in at the Grate by these Cruel and Unmerciful Men. And this is not only to me, but to several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and some Debtors Ironed, and put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the same Ward, next door to the House of Office, where we have a Yard not Three Rod of ground, for Twenty Men, most Criminals, to walk in, with a Sink in the middle. I am a Man of above Sixty Three Years of Age; and <hi>Charles</hi> the First, and <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, of Blessed Memory, I serv'd them in their Wars, and have had a Commission for above Thirty Years. Now the God of Peace, that brought again from the Dead our Lord Jesus Christ, will deliver us from the Hands of those Keepers, whose Mercies are Cruelties. And thus if Their Majesties will be pleased to grant to me a poor Prisoner, after my Discharge, Their Commission, I will venture both Life, Limbs, Liberty, Estate, and Fortune, to Serve Their Majesties in their Wars, to make them still Victors.

And <hi>James King</hi> the Under-Keeper, broke the Goatch, (that is, a Pitcher,) of Beer, that we sent for into the Town to Relieve our selves withal.

And whereas you say, you Read my Letter to <hi>King</hi> the Gaoler of <hi>Ipswich;</hi> he the said <hi>James King</hi> was Keeper, or Under-Keeper, of <hi>Bury St. Edmond,</hi> and was the Man that broke our Goarch, and spilt our Beer; and also when I Petitioned the Judg of the Lenten Assizes, the said <hi>James King</hi> did Assert to the Judg, <hi>That we were Drinking King</hi> Jame<hi>'s Health.</hi> Thus to shelter his Cruelty with a gloss of pretended Zeal, it was a plain Lie from a Quaker that pretends the Light, but his Ways are Darkness.

Instead of Cherishing Virtue, this <hi>Patrick</hi> the Keeper is the great promoter of all Vices that can be performed by Rude and Morose Servants, which are the only Men he employs; he encourages them most that can find out new ways to Insult over us, so that we are now in great fear of being Chained,

Thus hoping our Representatives now Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in Parliament will Correct the Arbitrary Government of Cruel and Morose Gaolers, or otherwise those poor Prisoners, both Men and Women, that are Committed into their Custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, had as good be cast into a Den of Lions, or a Nest of Wolves; from all which Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>Good Lord Deliver us.</hi> Yours, <hi>John Suckerman,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                        <p>And your Petitioner, (being a poor <hi>Feme-Covert,</hi> destitute of Money and Friends, and

                        <p>And at the same time she was Arrested, her Husband <hi>Taylor</hi> was in the same Warrant, (as indeed the Law requires,) and join'd with her in the Action, and very easie to be taken, and to have been Arrested as well as she; but (whether by connivance, or contrivance,) he was waved and never yet medled withal, but she only lies in Prison, under close Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, being held to special Bail, because at the Suit of an Attorney. <hi>Smith</hi> refusing to come to any manner of end, or to accept of a Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, altho' offered on her part. And she is altogether slighted and neglected by her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and being a poor Married Woman, want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both Money and Friends, may perish in Prison, except some course be taken to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it, for which end she now Petitions the Judges of Assize.</p>
                        <pb n="72" facs="tcp:205150:66"/>
                        <p>And it is Observable, that <hi>William Patrick</hi> the Younger, (the Gaoler's Son,) a young At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney, offered to undertake her business a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Smith,</hi> pretending to move the Court against his extravagant Bills, and undue man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of proceedings, and in pursuance thereof got <hi>Smith</hi>'s Bills and Letters into his hands, and neither did any thing for her Relief, or Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or for her Enlargement out of Prison, nor will restore her Papers. For which she Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the Judges for remedy, and that he may be Ordered to shew cause why he restores not her Papers.</p>
                        <p>And she likewise in <hi>Easter-Term</hi> last, and several times since, demanded a Copy of the Warrant, (upon which she was Arrested and Committed,) of <hi>William Patrick</hi> the Gaoler, (being willing to pay him reasonably for the same,) to the intent to enable her self to make defence against <hi>Smith,</hi> and procure her Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by <hi>Supersedeas,</hi> or otherwise. But the said Gaoler constantly refuses to let her have any Copy, for which she likewise Petitions the Judges.</p>
                        <p>She hath likewise in her Petition prayed a Remedy against all the said Parties for the Tort and Injury.</p>
                        <p>And the purport hereof is to instruct her Counsel to manage her Petition before the Judges, against all the said persons upon the whole matter, and to effect her Liberty, if it be possible, or otherwise to provide a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Remedy as the Law shall direct.</p>
                        <pb n="73" facs="tcp:205150:66"/>
                        <p>If she had <hi>Smith</hi>'s Bills and Letters out of young <hi>Patrick</hi>'s hands, she should shew them to the Judges, and sufficiently Evince <hi>Smith</hi>'s Irregular proceedings, and the injustice of his Cause.</p>
                        <p>The Gaoler's refusal to let her have a Copy of the Warrant, is expresly against a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Branch of the <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> Act, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together looks like a Combination between <hi>Smith</hi> and <hi>Patrick</hi> the Gaoler, and <hi>Patrick</hi> the Attorney, and the Womans Husband, to keep her in Prison.</p>
                        <p>And because the Defendant <hi>Susanna Taylor,</hi> preferred this Petition to the Judges, and moved upon it, (altho' without effect, for they sham'd off the matter with the Judg in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant <hi>Susan</hi>'s absence, (she not being brought down in person as she desired,) so nothing was done,) <hi>Patrick</hi> the Gaoler immediately turn'd her out of her Lodging into a Nasty, Cold, and Loathsome Room over the Dungeon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any manner of thing to lie upon, save on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a small parcel of Straw, as if it had been for a Dog, and without any thing to cover her from the Cold, and kept her almost continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Locked up therein, and so despitefully and hardly used her, that thereby she got a Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which might have cost her her Life, if God had not been the more Merciful to her.</p>
                        <p>And as for young <hi>Patrick</hi> the Attorney, he thereupon gave her an extravagant Bill, by which he charges her with Four Pound Seven Shillings and upwards, whereas in truth nothing
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:205150:67"/>was done by him for the same, to the Prisoners benefit, or advantage; but she remains in the same Condition she was in before he pretended to undertake her business, which was in <hi>Hilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-Term,</hi> 1689.</p>
                        <p>As for the Prisoners Husband, <hi>Samuel Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,</hi> (he being at liberty himself without any mollestation,) has made Sale of all her Goods which she had when she Married him, and has converted the Money to his own use, and he hath also got into his hands all the Rents of certain Lands and Tenements which the Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner had in Trust from her former Husband, for the bringing up of the Children she had by him; and the said <hi>Taylor</hi> has likewise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the same wholly to his own use. And with much Inhumanity and Cruelty absolutely refuses to let the Prisoner have any part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, or any manner of sustentation to preserve her from perishing in Prison, she living now wholly upon the Charity of Friends, which in short time will be at a period, and being her self growing into considerable Years, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly declining in her Natural Functions and Abilities, to sustain and undergo so great a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and Inhuman Usage and Severity.</p>
                        <p>And by Protestation doth Assert, That she believes that this great Barbarity is imposed upon her, in premeditated Cruelty, to cause her to perish in Prison in a deplorable manner, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any manner of Reason, or Just Cause.</p>

                     <head>A Fifth Letter from the Gaol in <hi>Bury St. Edmond.</hi>

                     <opener>
                        <salute>SIR,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>WHEN I. last Writ to you, I sent you a Copy of my Petition to the Judges the last Assizes at <hi>Bury</hi> against one <hi>Christopher Smith</hi> an Attorney at Law, and against <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Patrick</hi> the Gaoler of <hi>Bury,</hi> and <hi>William Patrick</hi> (his Son,) an Attorney likewise, for their respective Misdemeanors, (as you may see the Papers import,) I was then in hopes that I should by this time have heard of an Act of this present Parliament, for the Relief of my self, and Thousands more in this Nation, that Sigh and Groan under the Tyranny and Cruelty of the Common Gaolers, and other Oppressors of these times, which is such, that it makes our Lives no less than Quotidian Deaths, attended with most exquisite Torments, (all our Miseries and Calamities being considered together as one intire Mass,) and that to such an extream degree, that Death it self, (could we but Die at once,) would be to us a Divine Favour and Happiness.</p>
                     <p>This Unhappy Condition, I think, (as my Circumstances are,) doth concern me more
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:205150:68"/>largely than any other Mortal I can meet with, (as you may in part perceive by those Papers already sent you, which I shall not need to repeat,) for as I am a Married-Wife, I am so strictly bound up, that, (being a poor Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and wholly deserted by my Cruel Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,) I can no way help my self.</p>
                     <p>In short, Sir, I am so Tyrannically and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barously treated by <hi>William Patrick</hi> our Gao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, ever since I wrote to you, that I am com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel'd to let you know some more of my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent occurring Grievances. Which are, That now all persons living are wholly kept from me by one <hi>Matthew Rogers</hi> (the present Turn-Key,) by the Gaoler's express Order and Command, and none permitted to come into the Gaol to me on any occasion whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, so that I want all things to sustain my Life, and have no person whatsoever permitted to assist or help me in this my sad and deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Condition, with any Relief, or otherwise.</p>
                     <p>On which Account I verily and unfeignedly do fear, I shall perish, and daily expect to lose my Life, and be made away by the Gaoler's Cruelty and Revenge in some manner or other.</p>
                     <p>This manner of Savage Cruelty of our Gaoler, is not only expresly against the Law and late Statute made and provided against Gaolers, but is no where practised in any Gaol in <hi>England,</hi> but only in this of <hi>Bury.</hi> And therefore being in this Mortal Fear and Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension, and transported with such Horror and Dread, I have thought of Petitioning the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:205150:68"/>But being only a single person, I thought it convenient first to beg your Advice and Counsel, whether you think it will be to any purpose for any single Prisoner to do it alone, and to direct my course therein.</p>
                     <p>And that you may see and know what cause of Complaint I have against the Gaoler's Son, (who is a young Attorney, and thrusts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into my business, under the specious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of Infallibly procuring my Liberty and Remedy against the first Aggressor <hi>Smith,</hi> by whom, and at whose Suit, I am unjustly made a Prisoner, as my Papers have already shewed you,) I have herewith sent you a Copy of his Bill, for what he pretends to have done for me, altho' in truth there was nothing done; for altho' he charges me, (as you may see,) with Forty Five Shillings for Moving the Court against <hi>Smith,</hi> and Forty Two Shillings Four Pence more for Filing a Bill against him for the Money he owed me the same time I was Imprisoned, in all Four Pound Seven Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings Four Pence; yet there was never any thing effected upon the Motion, (if any such was made,) nor my Liberty gained thereby, nor any more proceedings against him for my Money, than only to forejudg him, and take out a Writ against him, which was never Sued or Executed, (altho' the person was and is easie to be taken,) and so both these Concerns were totally neglected, and desisted in that very Juncture, which should, and would have given me a Remedy in either. So that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:205150:69"/>here is much pretended to be done, but to no other purpose, than only, (as if it had been premeditated,) to render me in a worse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition than I was at the first of my Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by throwing away so much Money without any effect, (if it were really due,) and by irritating and provoking the Spirits of all them with whom I had to do. And yet himself at the same time detains all my Papers and Proceedings from me, and thereby hinders all others from Acting or Proceeding for me therein.</p>
                     <p>And it is plainly apparent, that one main end of the Gaoler's Cruelty towards me, is to squeeze this pretended Money for his Son (the Darling of the Gaoler) out of my very Blood and Vitals, having nothing else wherewith to pay him, for his doing nothing for me, but rendring me more effectually Miserable than he found me.</p>
                     <p>And its a very remarkable instance of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence and Injustice, in that young <hi>Patrick,</hi> in the very last of his Bill charges me Three Shillings Four Pence for attending the Judges the last Assizes, at which time, (forasmuch as I then Petitioned against him,) he then stood in the Quality and Capacity of a Criminal, and not of an Advocate for me, and was there to Answer his own Misdemeanors, and not to Act for me.</p>
                     <p>Finally, Sir, I beg your Charitable Advice and Counsel to a poor distressed Woman under so great Affliction, from a Concatenated Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:205150:69"/>of Wicked Men, against whom I can yet find no Remedy, either from Judg, or Justice, (such is the Cruelty of my Unhappy Fate,) and the favour of a Letter from you by the next Post in Answer hereto, for according to your Directions I will steer my course. Hoping by that time you will be Enabled to send us the Joyful News of an Act of Parliament, (obtained by your indefatigable and unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leld Industry, and Herculean Toil and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,) for the Relief of poor distressed Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners, of which Number is</p>

                     <p>And as to our Gaoler, I could inform the Parliament of many horrid things done by him, although not all of them proved by my own proper self, but by several others who have been Prisoners, and are gone, and by some now in Prison that dare not speak for fear of worse Usage, and others that are Asses of Burthen, who will bear all things before they will help themselves. But I conceive all this ought to be by way of Articles of Misdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and breach of Law, to be drawn up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Gaoler; wherein how far my single Operations and Endeavors may avail, I desire to be informed by you; wishing with all my Heart you could make it a general thing all <hi>England</hi> over, for, <hi>Vis unita fortior,</hi> and the Complaints of many will prevail, where that of a few cannot.</p>

                        <hi>Moses Pitt</hi> of <hi>London</hi> Bookseller, being Committed Prisoner to the <hi>Fleet, April</hi> the 20th, 1689, lodg'd on the Gentlemen's side in a Chamber which the <hi>Warden</hi> Values at Eight Shillings <hi>per</hi> Week, tho' of Right it's but Two Shillings and Four Pence, the rest being Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action, (and the said <hi>Moses Pitt,</hi> at the time of Writing of this, has Two Chambers within the Rules of the <hi>King</hi>'s-<hi>Bench</hi> for One Shilling Three Pence <hi>per</hi> Week, twice as good as the said Chamber,) he the said <hi>Pitt</hi> continued in the said Chamber from the said 20th of <hi>April,</hi> 1689, to the 26th of <hi>August,</hi> 1690, which was Seventy Weeks, and Three Days, in which time the said <hi>Pitt</hi> had paid the <hi>Warden</hi> his Commitment-Fee, Two Pounds Four Shillings and Six Pence, whereas there is but Four Pence due; <hi>Pitt</hi> also paid him Fourteen Shillings for
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:205150:74"/>Two Day-Writs, and was to pay him Eight Shillings Four Pence at the going out of the Gate, (every Prisoner there in Execution pays Eleven Shillings and Two Pence a Day when he goes abroad about his Business,) but the said <hi>Warden</hi> kept his said Fourteen Shillings, and would not let him go out of the Gates of the Prison, by which the said <hi>Pitt</hi> lost his Tryals, which was many Thousand Pounds damage to him. The said <hi>Pitt</hi> also paid the said <hi>Warden</hi> for Chamber-Rent Fifteen Pounds, and the said <hi>Warden</hi> had of Mr. <hi>Stephen Æ²pman,</hi> Fellow of <hi>Eaton-College,</hi> and Brother to <hi>Pitt</hi>'s Wife, (who was Committed Prisoner upon a False Oath Sworn in the open Court of the <hi>Common-Pleas,</hi> by two of <hi>Pitt</hi>'s Adversaries, on <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> the 15th, 1689, an Account of which is at large related in <hi>PITT</hi>'s CASE herewith Printed,) and of <hi>John Pitt</hi> Son of the said <hi>Moses Pitt,</hi> and of Mr. <hi>Lock,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bland,</hi> the said <hi>Pitt</hi>'s Friends, Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Pounds Six Shillings and Eight Pence, for one Nights Lodging. Notwithstanding the said <hi>Warden</hi> of the <hi>Fleet</hi> had received of the said <hi>Pitt,</hi> and his Friends, (which was all upon <hi>Pitt</hi>'s account,) Thirty Five Pounds Five Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and Two Pence, when there was due to him, and the Parson of the <hi>Fleet,</hi> besides the one Nights Lodging for the said <hi>Pitt</hi>'s Four Friends, but Nine Pounds Eight Shillings and Four Pence, from the said 20th of <hi>April,</hi> 1689, to the 26th of <hi>August,</hi> 1690, upon which Day he threw down the said <hi>Pitt</hi> into
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:205150:75"/>the <hi>Wards,</hi> or <hi>Dungeon,</hi> of the said Prison, and there Lock'd him up within the Door of the said <hi>Wards</hi> for Five Days, without allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him any Bed, or any thing else to Lodg on; and altho' the said <hi>Pitt</hi>'s Wife came to see her Husband in this Miserable place, he the said <hi>Warden</hi> would not permit the said <hi>Pitt</hi> to come up into the Yard of the Prison to speak with his Wife, upon which the said <hi>Pitt</hi>'s Wife was forc'd to send him a Bed to Lodg on, and there the said <hi>Pitt</hi> continued and Lodg'd in a Room with Twenty Seven more Prisoners, most of which Liv'd on the Basket, and Beg'd at the Grate; one of which said Mendicant Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, after he had, in order to take the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Act, Sworn himself not worth more than Ten Pounds, Died at the said <hi>Pitt</hi>'s Bed Head, (he was a Man full of Vermin, of a Corrupt Body, and Bursten,) at Twelve of the Clock at Night. And one Day the said <hi>Pitt</hi> being at Prayers in the Chappel of the said Prison, was taken with a <hi>Delirium,</hi> or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plectick Fit, and getting into this Noisome Cell, threw himself on his Bed, and so lay some Hours, upon which one of his Friends goes to the <hi>Warden</hi> and acquaints him in what Condition the said <hi>Pitt</hi> lay, and desir'd him, <hi>That the said</hi> Pitt <hi>might have a Chamber till he was well, paying him for it.</hi> But the said <hi>Warden</hi> denied the said Friend of <hi>Pitt</hi>'s that Request. In this same dismal place did the said <hi>Pitt</hi> continue, from the 26th of <hi>August,</hi> 1690, to the 16th of <hi>May,</hi> 1691, in all which
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:205150:75"/>time he was not able to keep himself clean from Vermin, being forc'd to Louse himself most commonly Twice a Day, either in the open Yard, or in the House of Office; for at any time if the said <hi>Pitt</hi> had the use of any of the Gentlemen's Chambers for his Devotions, Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and Lowsing himself, if the said <hi>Warden</hi> came to hear of it, both he and his Wife would be very Angry with the said Gentlemen, and would hunt him thence as a Partridg upon the Mountains. And that the Reader may be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, that it was impossible for the said <hi>Pite</hi> to keep himself clean from Vermin, whilst he continued in the said <hi>Wards</hi> of the <hi>Fleet</hi> Prison, he doth Assure his Reader, that many of his Chamber-Fellows were so Lowsie, that as they either walk'd, or sat down, you might have pick'd Lice off from their outward Garments; but enough of this, least my Reader Scrubs and Scratches at the Reading of it. The said <hi>Pitt</hi> was remov'd from the <hi>Fleet</hi> Prison to the <hi>King's-Bench</hi> on the 16th of <hi>May,</hi> 1691, and the said <hi>Pitt</hi> is inform'd by Mr. <hi>Walcot Hobson</hi> Clerk to the <hi>Warden</hi> of the <hi>Fleet,</hi> that the said <hi>Warden</hi> has sent over an Action against the said <hi>Pitt</hi> for Fourteen Pounds odd Shillings for Chamber-Rent due to him. Now the said <hi>Pitt</hi> doth Aver, (not to reckon the Seventeen Pounds Six Shillings and Eight Pence he had for one Nights Lodging for <hi>Pitt</hi>'s Four Friends,) he has over-paid the <hi>Warden</hi> for Chamber-Rent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Eight Pounds Ten Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and Two Pence, to the 26th of <hi>August,</hi>
                        <pb n="90" facs="tcp:205150:76"/>1690, but however he the said <hi>Pitt</hi> is very willing to come to a <hi>Quantum</hi> Merit with the said <hi>Warden,</hi> both for his Chamber-Rent from <hi>April</hi> the 20th, 1689, to <hi>August</hi> the 26th, 1690, and from <hi>August</hi> the 26th, 1690, to <hi>May</hi> the 16th, 1691, (which was the time the said <hi>Pitt</hi> lay in the <hi>Wards</hi> of the said Prison) and will refer it to a Jury of Twelve Honest Men, and stand by their Award.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pitt</hi> has Two things more to Charge on the said <hi>Warden,</hi> the First is concerning a Prisoner that is Dead, which was one <hi>Mr. Yardley</hi> who was an Attorney of <hi>Clifford</hi>'s-<hi>Inn,</hi> put into the Prison of the <hi>Fleet</hi> by his own Brother who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Queen <hi>Dotoager.</hi> This <hi>Mr. Yard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> the <hi>Warden</hi> threatned him to put him into the <hi>Wards</hi> of the Prison for <hi>non-payment</hi> of Chamber-Rent. Mr. <hi>Yardly</hi> told him, <hi>Sir, If you put me into the</hi> Wards <hi>of the Prison, I shall Die, for I am a Sickly Man.</hi> The <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> replyed, <hi>Better you Dio, than I lose my Chamber-Rent,</hi> and did turn him into the <hi>Wards,</hi> where he fell Sick, but was afterwards taken into a Chamber, and soon after Died, and had neither <hi>Parson, Physician, Apothecary,</hi> nor <hi>Nurse,</hi> to Attend him.</p>

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:205150:76"/>The <hi>Warden</hi> Answered, <hi>It was the Rate the Judges had set on that Chamber, and if they had not set a Rate, he would have Sixteen Shillings a Week for that Chamber, for he would make what he pleased of his own.</hi>

                     <head>Reasons offered to Creditors, against the Imprisoning the Bodies of their DEBTORS.</head>
                     <p>FIRST, If the Debtor be an Honest Man, he will give up into the hands of his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor all his Estate he shall be seized or possessed of, (except for necessary Living,) which is as much as was originally given at the Common Law.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It puts the Debtor in a better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to serve the <hi>Crown,</hi> the <hi>Common-Wealth,</hi> to provide for himself and Family, to be Just to his Creditors: Whenas, his Imprisonment is an Obstruction to <hi>All.</hi> As for instance,</p>
                     <p>A Debtor owes to Six several Persons 100 <hi>l.</hi> and is by Profession a Divine, without a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; a Lawyer; or, by Trade a Clothier,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:205150:77"/>Printer, Book-binder, Carpenter, or the like; and hath a Wife and Two Children, and is worth but 100 <hi>l.</hi> in all the World; upon a modest Calculation, it shall cost the Creditor and Debtor this 100 <hi>l.</hi> in a Years time. And (giving Allowance for <hi>greater</hi> and <hi>smaller Debts, higher</hi> and <hi>lower Charges</hi>) it becomes the Case of every Honest Debtor; so as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:205150:86"/>no more, tho' they all took the Ground of me for the full time that they Liv'd in their Houses, provided they had no disturbance, the which they had not.</p>
                  <p>This Sir <hi>Edward Hales</hi> hearing that the Chancellor had a promise from King <hi>James</hi> of this Ground, and that he was to Grant it me, he Acquaints King <hi>James,</hi> that the Chancellor Beg'd that Ground of him, not for himself, but his Landlord, and that it would be an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to the said <hi>Hales</hi> his House, being on the said rearing of Buildings, prevail'd with the King, he being a greater Favourite than the Chancellor, to break his Promise with the Chancellor, and to give him the said Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Hales</hi> the Ground, not only on the back fide of his House, but the next House also; which the King did. Upon which he fell a Building up against his Neighbours House, and in part spoil'd that, to the great prejudice of his Neighbour. The Chancellor by this broke his Agreement with me, and although upon my taking of the said Ground of the said <hi>Webb</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid, and had divided the said Garden-Ground, by Building Brick-walls, to each House, they do so Enjoy it, yet the said Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Hales,</hi> and some others, never paid me one Farthing for it; I do confess, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tess Dowager of <hi>Plymouth</hi> Built her own Wall; I also Built that new Wall adjoining to <hi>Storey</hi>'s House, on the back side of <hi>Princes-Court,</hi> and also took care to fill up all low Grounds in that part of St. <hi>James</hi>'s-Park, between the Bird-Cages
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:205150:86"/>and that Range of Buildings in <hi>Duke street,</hi> whose Back-Front is towards the said Park, where the Water in Moist-weather Stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, and was the cause of Fogs and Mists, with Garden-Mould, and Sowd it with Hay-Seed, so that thereby that part of the Park is as clear from Fogs, and as Healthy, as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of the said Park, for all which I was not paid one Farthing. I also at my own Cost Cleans'd a great part of the Common-Shoars, not only about the said Park, but <hi>Westminster</hi> also, and Rais'd low Grounds, and Laid out about Twelve Thousand Pounds in Buildings, whereby I have made <hi>Westminster</hi> as Healthy a place, as any other parts about <hi>London,</hi> and as Commodious for Gentry to Live in, which has brought a Considerable Trade to that part of the Town. Among other Buildings, I Built Stables for about Three Hundred Horses, and Coach-Houses, the best about Town; and although Prince <hi>George</hi>'s Pads, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were on the Ground, yet when His Majesty King <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> came first to <hi>London,</hi> which was in <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> 1688, all his Coaches and Horses were brought into my Stables and Coach-Houses, and His Grooms and their Wives and Children had Lodgings, and other Conveniences, till King <hi>James</hi> Horses and Coaches were remov'd from the <hi>Muse,</hi> which was about <hi>April</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; about which time I Lett that great House, in which the late Lord Chancellor <hi>Jefferies</hi> Liv'd, to the Three <hi>Dutch</hi> Embassadors which came out of <hi>Holland</hi> to Congratulate Their
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:205150:87"/>Majesties Happy Accession to the Crown, after the Rate of Seven Hundred and Twenty Pound <hi>per Annum.</hi> The Agreement I made, was with one Mr. <hi>John Arnold,</hi> a <hi>Dutch-Man,</hi> their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary. Witness to the said Agreement were Mr. <hi>Ridgley,</hi> (in whose House in the <hi>Pall-Mall</hi> the said Embassadors Lay <hi>Incognito;</hi>) and into whose hands, after our Signing and Sealing, we intrusted the said Contract to be kept on the behalf of us both; as it can be Testified by one Mr. <hi>Johnson</hi> a Coach-Man in <hi>Hedg-Lane</hi> near the <hi>Muse,</hi> who was the other Witness to it. But this said <hi>Ridgley,</hi> after my being thrown into Prison by <hi>Adiel Mill,</hi> did break his Trust, and deliver up into the Hands of my Adversary <hi>Mill</hi> this my Contract, to the Ruin me and my Family. What the said <hi>Ridgley,</hi> and <hi>Arnold,</hi> had of my Adversary <hi>Mill</hi> for this Breach of Trust, besides Fish-Dinners, they best know, I leave the World to judg. I am satisfied in my Conscience that <hi>Mills</hi> gave them Guineas, a considerable quantity, besides a Present of Dr. <hi>Vossius</hi> Letters, Printed by him, to.... I am inform'd, that the Embassador's Porter had Ten Guineas, besides Bottles of Wine, and Neats Tongues, for his good will in delivering the Keys of the said House to the said <hi>Mill,</hi> whilst the said Embassadors were in the said House, and the said <hi>Mill</hi> kept the said Keys one Night, and sent them to the said Porter next Day, with some more Bottles of Wine, that so he might have Friendship with the said Porter, who was Angry with the said
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:205150:87"/>
                     <hi>Mill</hi> for carrying away the Keys. The Porter and <hi>Mill</hi>'s Man, (whom he had left in the House that Night, expecting the Embassadors would have been gone the next Morning, which they did not,) had Fought a severe Battle. Now as to this part of my Narrative of <hi>Mill</hi>'s being concern'd with me, I shall now faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Relate.</p>
                  <p>Having undertaken the Printing of an <hi>AT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAS,</hi> or Description of the whole World, which will be about Twelve Volums in <hi>Folio,</hi> Maps and Description of Imperial Paper, and being much incouraged by Dr. <hi>Fell</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Oxon,</hi> I took of him the Printing-House at <hi>Oxford,</hi> called the <hi>Theatre,</hi> where I have finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Four of the Volums; containing the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of the <hi>Northern</hi> Countries of <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> &amp;c. as also <hi>Sweden, Denmark, Muscovey, Poland,</hi> the Seventeen <hi>Provinces</hi> of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and all the Empire of <hi>Germany,</hi> and have Two Volums more almost finished, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>East-Indies,</hi> and all the <hi>Turkish-Empire;</hi> and did also Purchase of the Bishop a great quantity of Books to the Value of many Thousands of Pounds. And did in the latter end of King <hi>Charles</hi>'s time. Print great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Bibles, Testaments, Common-Prayers,</hi> &amp;c. in all Volums, whereby I brought down the Price of Bibles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> more than half, which did great good at that time, (Popery then being likely to over-flow us.) In the Year 1683, I went into <hi>Ireland,</hi> where staying some conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable time, having Two Partners in the Bible-Trade,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:205150:88"/>they pretended to me, when I came back, that I ow'd them some Hundreds of Pounds, and they Lock'd up my <hi>Oxford</hi>-Ware-House, I Mortgaged my Estate to my Lady <hi>Jones</hi> for 3800, with which Moneys I intended to pay my Debts, and what remained, to lay out in Building on the said <hi>Blew-Boars-Head</hi> Estate, and for that purpose I was resolv'd to part with all my Stock of Books, (except my <hi>ATLAS,</hi>) and also to call in what Debts were due to me. At that time I ow'd the said <hi>Adiel Mill</hi> for Paper 62 <hi>l.</hi> 12 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> which Moneys I paid him in full of all Accounts, I having then no other Dealings with him; and soon after went to my Bible-Partners to pay them 500 <hi>l.</hi> and to that purpose gave them a Bill on Mr. <hi>Richard Hawkins,</hi> which Moneys they sent for, but in the interim <hi>Mill</hi> coming to <hi>Parker</hi> and <hi>Guy</hi> where I then was, would have perswaded me not to pay them the said 500 <hi>l.</hi> telling me before their Faces, that they would Cheat me of the said Moneys, and would not let me have my Books; and said, they were a Couple of Knaves. Upon which <hi>Mill,</hi> without my consent, for I would have paid the Moneys, sent a Porter with a Note to forbid <hi>Hawkins</hi> paying the 500 <hi>l.</hi> Upon the receipt of which Note <hi>Hawkins</hi> refus'd the payment of the Moneys, although the Brother of <hi>Guy</hi> had told out a great part of it. Upon which <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> and <hi>Guy</hi> enter'd an Action in the <hi>Counter</hi> against me for the 500 <hi>l.</hi> and <hi>Parker</hi> came to my Shop with a Sarjeant of the <hi>Counter</hi> to Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:205150:88"/>me, but by the Advice of <hi>Mill</hi> I Avoided my Shop, and went into the the County of <hi>Middlesex</hi> till Bail was given to their Action, and then I had a Tryal with them at <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> before the then Lord Chief Justice <hi>Jefferies,</hi> who gave Verdict against me for the 500 <hi>l.</hi> In the Interim <hi>Mill</hi> had out of Mr. <hi>Hawkin's</hi> Hands about 1000 <hi>l.</hi> of my Moneys. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that, he makes me give him a <hi>Statute-Staple</hi> for 5000 <hi>l.</hi> which said <hi>Statute-Staple</hi> I entred into to him <hi>June</hi> the First, 1684, he then having about 1000 <hi>l.</hi> of my Moneys in his Hands, as will appear by his own Accounts, and his Answer to my Bill in <hi>Chaneery.</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this, he has Sworn to a Bill in <hi>Chancery</hi> sometime after prefer'd by my Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants against him and my self, that they might, paying their Rent, Enjoy quiet Possession, <hi>That</hi> Bona Fide <hi>I ow'd him</hi> 5000 l. <hi>when I gave him the said</hi> Statute-Staple. The Truth is, I was so far from owing him the said <hi>Mill</hi> 5000 <hi>l.</hi> at that time, that he really ow'd me 700 <hi>l.</hi> as will appear by his own Accounts, and also I is Answer to my Bill in <hi>Chancery.</hi> After which I put into <hi>Mill</hi>'s Hands all, or very near all, my Stock of Books, both Bound and in Quires, <hi>ATLASSES, ATLAS-Paper, Coper-Plates, Pictures, Printing-Press, Letters,</hi> &amp;c. which came to several Thousand Pounds, which Moneys he received. All in Trust to raise Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys for to pay the Charges of my Building as aforesaid. And I did also put into his Hands all my Book-Debts, Bills, and Bonds, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:205150:89"/>came to some Thousands of Pounds. I also Rais'd on my Estate 4500 <hi>l.</hi> more, which was paid into <hi>Mill</hi>'s Hands, besides other great Summs of Moneys which I borrowed on my own Bond, as of Mr <hi>John Hearne</hi> 400 <hi>l.</hi> Mr. <hi>Stephen Æ²pman</hi> 100 <hi>l.</hi> all which were paid into <hi>Mill</hi>'s Hands. And further, when I Lett my House in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Church-Yard,</hi> to Mr. <hi>Joseph Watts,</hi> and Sold him a Considerable Quantity of Books, and Houshold-Stuff, with what Bonds he gave me for payment, came also into the Hands of <hi>Mill.</hi> And further, Upon the Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of <hi>Mill,</hi> and his Vows, (even that of the Sacrament,) and his Protestations to me, <hi>That he hated a Trick, and that he had no Design to Deceive me of One Farthing, nor to get One Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by me, but purely out of Kindness,</hi> (we being Brother and Sister's Children,) <hi>and that I should not Suspect him, but that he would be Just to me,</hi> He caus'd me to give him first 100 l. <hi>per Annum</hi> out of my Estate of the <hi>Blew-Boars-Head;</hi> and a short time after that, being not satisfied, he caus'd me to give him 200 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> out of the said Estate, pretending to me, <hi>That by his Managery of this great Concern, he would Raise me an Estate, (besides this</hi> 200 <hi>l.</hi> per Annum,) <hi>of</hi> 1000 <hi>l.</hi> per Annum. After I had done this, he being not satisfied, he Urg'd me to make over to him all my said Estate of the <hi>Blew-Boars Head,</hi> and <hi>Antulope-Alley,</hi> for 11300 <hi>l.</hi> which Cost me 1200 <hi>l.</hi> Building, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, I could have had for the said Estate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I Built on it, about 7000 <hi>l.</hi> so that I
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:205150:89"/>Reckon the Estate Cost me near 19000 <hi>l.</hi> which he caus'd me, (under the Notion of Kindness and Friendship, and that he would be Just and Faithful to me, and that he had no Design in the least to Wrong nor Oppress me, but to Preserve me and my Estate,) to make over to him; and that he would, within a Fortnights time after my Signing and Sealing of the said Deeds, give me a Deed of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on under his Hand and Seal; and the Reason he gave me, why he would not have a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption in the Deeds, was, <hi>That I owing some Moneys on the Account of my Buildings, was that my Creditors might fall on me, and take out a</hi> Statute <hi>of</hi> Bankrupt <hi>against me, and so take the Estate out of his, and, so of Consequence, out of my Hands; still protesting the greatest Sincerity and Honesty in the World, and what he did in this was for my Good, without any Advantage to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi> And under the same Spetious Pretences, <hi>Mill</hi> prevail'd with me to make him Deeds and Conveyances of all my Wife's Estate, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of which was 100 <hi>l. per Annum.</hi> And also a Free-hold Estate in <hi>Portsmouth</hi> of 9 <hi>l.</hi> 10 <hi>s. per Annum.</hi> And also of a Free-hold E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state in <hi>Westminster</hi> of 68 <hi>l. per Annum.</hi> He also got Deeds of me for all the Real and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Estate I have in this World, even my Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and Houshold-Goods. After I had made him all these Deeds and Conveyances aforesaid, I then demanded of him, That he should per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form with me, and give me a Redemption un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Hand and Seal, according to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:205150:90"/>He puts me off from time to time, and promiseth he would do it this time, and that time, I being in possession of all my Estate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and Personal, and receiv'd my Rents in my own Name, and he and his Uncle <hi>Brent</hi> receiv'd my Rents, what they receiv'd, in my Name; for according to our Agreement, he was never to do otherwise, but all Rents were to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in my Name, and he was to be at all times Accountable to me for them, and I never to be disturb'd in my Possession; and when I had paid all my Debts that I ow'd, he then was to give up to me all my Deeds and Conveyances I had given him. After this he promised me, that if I would Sign his Accounts, which he and his Servants always kept, Errors excepted; and also he promised me Copeys of them, and if I found any Errors or Mistakes in them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it were Seven Years after, he would Rectifie it, and Account and Discount for any such Error or Mistake in Charging or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging; and that he would submit at all times his Accounts to any Two or Three Men I should Chuse, either <hi>Lawyers, Merchants,</hi> or any other good <hi>Tradesmen,</hi> or <hi>Accountants,</hi> and what did truly, and <hi>Bona Fide,</hi> appear due to him, he would give me Two Years time to pay him his Moneys, and then Resign up to me all my Deeds and Writings, and give me back my Estate. I believing these fair Promises of the said <hi>Mill,</hi> did pass the said Accounts; he also promising me the Deed of Redemption a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid. Soon after I had done this, I was at

He for a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time put me off, saying, <hi>He hated a Trick, and what would not I trust him, a Man of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, Honesty, and Credit.</hi> And thus he wheadled me off for a long time, at last I told him, <hi>Cousin, I do not doubt your Integrity, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty, and Credit, but you are a Mortal-man, and you may Die; if I owe you Moneys, you see I am willing to secure you your Moneys, and to pay you it; and I also owe Moneys to several other Persons, which in Justice and Good Conscience I ought likewise to pay, and will God willing pay them; and I have a Wife and Child which I ought in Duty to provide for, I having had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Fortune with her, and therefore pray let me have my Redemption according to our Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> For I told him further, <hi>That I did not doubt, but with the Selling what Stock of Books I had Æ²nsold, and gathering in what Debts were due to me, which were some Thousand Pounds, Selling of my Wife's Estate, and some stragling Estate of my own, and Printing on my</hi> ATLAS, <hi>which One Hundred and Fifty Pounds would Finish the Fifth Volum, containing the Description of the</hi> East-Indies, <hi>which, when Finished, would bring me Fifteen Hundred Pounds; and also the Sixth Volum, which contains the Description of the</hi> Turkish-Empire, <hi>is in a great part Printed; I should in a very few Years pay all my Debts, and reserve to my self, Wife, and Son, that Estate of mine of the</hi> Blew-Boars-Head, <hi>and</hi> Antulope-Alley, <hi>which then I had Lett at about</hi> 1200 l. per Annum, <hi>with the House I had lately Purchased
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:205150:91"/>of Mr.</hi> Robert Lord, <hi>adjoining to the said E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state.</hi> Upon which he fell out with me, and said, <hi>He would give me no Redemption.</hi> I then told him, <hi>I had not given him Possession, nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver would, for it was but a Trust.</hi> After this I met with Sir <hi>Edmond Wiseman</hi> in <hi>White-hall,</hi> and I Ask'd him, <hi>If he had Lent</hi> Mill <hi>any Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, and upon what Security?</hi> He told me, <hi>That he had Lent</hi> Mill 2000 <hi>l. on my Estate.</hi> He Ask'd me, <hi>Whether his Moneys was secure?</hi> I told him, <hi>No, for that he the said</hi> Wiseman <hi>knew, that what Deeds I had made to</hi> Mill, <hi>were but in Trust for me till I had paid my Debts.</hi> He the said <hi>Wiseman</hi> pretended Ignorance, and call'd <hi>Mill</hi> Knave, and desir'd me, that I would in two Days time come into St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Church-Yard,</hi> and talk with himself, and <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas Donning,</hi> about it. I promised him I would. Accordingly two Days after, I went to <hi>Donnings,</hi> and he carries me to the <hi>Queen's-Head-Tavern</hi> in <hi>Pater-Noster-Row, Wiseman</hi> coming up <hi>Pater-Noster-Row</hi> at the same time, went into the Tavern with us; we had not long been there but <hi>Mill</hi> came to us, (being I suppose sent for by them,) and after some lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time Discoursing of the Affair, <hi>Mill</hi> said, <hi>He had taken the Sacrament that Day,</hi> (for it was the Lord's Day,) <hi>for to be at Friendship with me, and that he would lay open all his Accounts, and come to a fare Account, and leave it to any Two. Men to Judg what was due to him, and would give me Two Years to pay him; and upon the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of what should appear due to him, be would

Upon which I did, upon his Request, promise to give him a Note on my Tenants to pay him my Rents, and then we parted Friends. A Day or Two after <hi>Mill</hi> meets me at the <hi>Gretian-Coffee-House</hi> in <hi>Devoroux-Court,</hi> and there Wheadles me, how kind he would be to me, <hi>If I would Sign the Notes he had drawn up on my Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants to pay him their Rent, and that the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was drawing by</hi> Donning, <hi>and that he would Sign and Seal it, for he Hated a Trick; and what mighty things he would do for me, with all the Promises of Kindness and Friendship in the World.</hi> Upon which, trusting to his Promises, I did Sign the Notes he had drawn up for my Tenants to pay him my Rents. After this I often went to him and demanded my Accounts and Redemption, according to our Agreement, and still he put me off for a Month time; at the Month end I met with <hi>Mill</hi> at the <hi>Gretian-Coffee-House</hi> in <hi>Devoroux-Court,</hi> in Company with his Wifes Uncle <hi>George Brent,</hi> who was employ'd to gather my Rents; and there I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain demanded my Redemption, upon which he calls me <hi>Knave</hi> and <hi>Rogue,</hi> and told me, <hi>He would not give me a Redemption.</hi> Upon which I told him, I would go immediately to

For which I ought to mention him with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Respect. And now <hi>Mill,</hi> (who is now a <hi>Bankrupt</hi> himself, and his Friend <hi>Donning</hi> in the Commission,) and Sir <hi>Edward Wiseman,</hi> (who has promised to stand by <hi>Mill</hi> as long as he is worth a Groat, and has also promised, that <hi>Mill</hi> shall be his Executor in Trust for his Wife and Children, when he Dies, for he is a great Admirer of <hi>Mill</hi>'s Projects, believing him the best Projector in <hi>England,</hi> as <hi>Mill</hi> related to me himself,) on the one side, and Mr. <hi>vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hearne,</hi> Mr. <hi>Nott,</hi> on the other side; are now Contending for my Real and Personal Estate, and I a Prisoner, not having any Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance from them out of my Estate to Buy Bread for my Self, Wife, or Son, (a Minor,) by reason of which, I am forc'd into the Wards of the Prison, where I Lodg among those that Beg at the Grate, and Live on the Basket, (that is on Charity). Soon after I was brought into this Prison, which was <hi>April</hi> the 20th. 1689, I prefer'd my Bill in Equity against <hi>Mill,</hi> (and also made <hi>Wiseman</hi> a Partey,) <hi>Mill</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered not my Bill till <hi>June</hi> the 25th, 1689. In my Bill I Charg'd him, <hi>That all the Deeds and Writings I made him were in Trust.</hi> I also
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:205150:95"/>Charg'd him, <hi>That I did Agree with him, that he should wave his pretended Purchase he made of me, and come to an Account from the very beginning of all our Accounts, altho' I had put my Hand and Seal to them, and if any Mistakes, to be Rectified, and what did appear Justly due to</hi> Mill, <hi>he the said</hi> Mill <hi>was to give me Two Years time to pay him the Moneys, and upon my payment of him the Moneys, be the said</hi> Mill <hi>was to give me up all my Deeds and Writings, and to deliver back to me the Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of all my Estate that he the said</hi> Mill <hi>had pretended he had Purchased of me. Mill</hi> in his Answer Denies, <hi>That he ever offered to wave his Purchase, and come to an Account; and deliver back the Possession of such part of my Estate as</hi> Mill <hi>hath so, as afore-said, Purchased.</hi> To prove that <hi>Mill</hi> has Forsworn himself in this, (which was the very Heart of my Bill,) I have <hi>Donning</hi> and <hi>Wiseman,</hi> who were at the first Agreement, as it's before related, but I dare not Examine either of these, not only because they are <hi>Mill</hi>'s Friends, but also because <hi>Donning,</hi> as he himself told me, I know no more of it, if he told me a Lie, it's his fault, has not only Brib'd a standing Jury-man at <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> but because he has Forsworn himself the 15th of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> 1689, in the <hi>Common-Pleas-Court</hi> in <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster-Hall,</hi> the Court then Sitting, the Story of which I will relate Anon. Nor <hi>Wiseman,</hi> because I am inform'd, he has Lent <hi>Mill</hi> since about 10000 <hi>l.</hi> and has an Order to Receive my Rents. At the Second Agreement was <hi>George Brent,</hi> who is <hi>Mill</hi>'s Wifes Uncle, (and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:205150:95"/>for that Reason I dare not Examine him,) and Mr. <hi>Joseph Avis.</hi> And at the Third Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was Mr. <hi>Stephen Æ²pman,</hi> at the <hi>Blew-Posts</hi> in <hi>Devoorux-Court,</hi> and other Witnesses, <hi>That</hi> Mill <hi>offered to wave his pretended Purchase, and come to an Account, and deliver back the Possession of such part of my Estate as</hi> Mill <hi>hath so, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, Purchased;</hi> and that after the 18th of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril,</hi> 1689, which was the Day he Arrested me, and before the 25th of <hi>June,</hi> 1689, which was the Day he Swore his Answer to my Bill in <hi>Chancery,</hi> are Mr. <hi>Jo. Hearne,</hi> Mr. <hi>Andrew Hatt,</hi> Mr. <hi>Francis Blith,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ambros Lock</hi> and his Wife, and several others. Upon this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury of <hi>Mill</hi> I indicted him in <hi>Westminster-Hall</hi> before my Lord Chief Justice <hi>Holt,</hi> in â€” 1690, but my Clerk in the <hi>Crown-Office</hi> drew the Indictment by Bill and Answer, before he Examined the Record, but when we came to Examine the Record, (<hi>Mill,</hi> or his Agent <hi>Donning,</hi> having Examined it before us,) we found in my Record the Word <hi>Certifie</hi> instead of <hi>Rectifie,</hi> upon which <hi>Mill</hi>'s Counsel stuck, though my Lord Chief Justice would have had them wav'd it, and come to the Merits of the Cause; but they would not, upon which I was <hi>Non-Suted.</hi> And being <hi>Mill</hi>'s Prisoner, and all the Incomes of my Estate being stop'd, I have not at present Moneys to Revive this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury again, and so this matter stands. Further, in my Bill I Charge him, <hi>That I was Bound for him to several Persons in great Summs of Moneys.</hi> In his said Answer he Swears, <hi>That I never was
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:205150:96"/>Obliged, or Bound, for him the said</hi> Mill <hi>for more than</hi> 400 l. Now to prove that <hi>Mill</hi> has For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sworn himself in this Paragraph of his Answer, I have in my Custody a Bond wherein I was Bound to Mrs. <hi>Susannah Leigh,</hi> as Executrix to her late Husband <hi>John Leigh,</hi> late Treasurer for the Company of <hi>Stationers,</hi> in 1300 <hi>l.</hi> for the payment of 650 <hi>l.</hi> principal Money, which he had Borrowed of the said <hi>John Leigh,</hi> the Bond is Dated the Eighth of <hi>March,</hi> 1686, and Witnessed by <hi>John Lilly</hi> an Attorney of <hi>Clif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords-Inn,</hi> (who made the Bond in the presence of the said <hi>Mill,</hi>) and <hi>Thomas Weller</hi> the said <hi>John Lilly</hi>'s Clerk. Upon the back of the Bond are Three several Indorsements written with <hi>Mill</hi>'s own Hand, wherein Mrs. <hi>Susanna Leigh</hi> doth acknowledg to have Received of <hi>Mill</hi> 500 <hi>l.</hi> as Witness her own Hand. Now the said Mrs. <hi>Leigh</hi> told me, <hi>That the last Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys that</hi> Mill <hi>paid her upon the said Bond was in</hi> May, 1689, And he Swore his Answer to my Bill in <hi>June</hi> following. A Third Pâ€” of <hi>Mill</hi>'s is in his Answer to a Bill prefer'd by my Tenants in <hi>Chancery,</hi> against my self and him for quiet possession. In his Answer to which he Swears, that in or about the first Day of <hi>June,</hi> 1685, (which was the Day I entred into the Statute of 5000 <hi>l.</hi> to him,) <hi>That I did,</hi> Bonn Fide, <hi>owe him the said</hi> Mill 5000 <hi>l.</hi> Now to prove that <hi>Mill</hi> has Forsworn himself in this Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph, I appeal to his own Accounts Sworn to by himself in his Answer to my Bill in <hi>Chancery,</hi> (a Copy of the Accounts stated the 24th of

All that I shall say more, as to <hi>Mill</hi>'s Answer, is, That to any thing that was material in my Bill, wherein it was not his Interest to Answer the Truth, as a good man ought to have done, he has Answered Evasively, Falsly, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly, so that his Answer is altogether Viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated and Corrupted. I now leave his Answer to my Bill, which is 140 Sheets of Paper, and come to other Transactions of his. The 13th of <hi>November,</hi> 1689, The Three <hi>Dutch</hi> Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors left my House the late Lord Chancellor <hi>Jefferies</hi> formerly liv'd in, my Wife, and Son, and some other of my Friends, being in the said House, <hi>Mill,</hi> and some of his Gang, came Violently into the said House, and laid hold of Mr. <hi>Ambros Lock</hi>'s Wife, struck her, and tore off her Head-Cloths; upon which she Grying out Murther, her Husband and some other Friends, being in the House, came to her assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,

And also that part of <hi>Adiel Mill</hi>'s Oath which concern'd Mr. <hi>Stephen Æ²pman.</hi> As to <hi>Adiel Mill,</hi> you have his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, in part, in this Narrative; what I shall say further of him, is, that he told me with his own Mouth, <hi>That one Day he went in search of his Wifes Father, and that if he could have met with him, he was resolv'd to Kill him.</hi> I Answer'd, <hi>I hope not so Cousin, for if you had done that, you would have been Hang'd, and your Wife and Children would have been Ruined. He</hi> Answered me, <hi>He had not troubled himself for that, for his Father-in-Law was a Rogue and a Villain, and deserv'd to Die.</hi> And he did Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and Actually Indict Mrs. <hi>Castell,</hi> his Wifes Sister, for Perjury, and did Try the Perjury before my Lord Chief Justice <hi>Herbert,</hi> But she got off Clear; and he the said <hi>Mill</hi> would at the same time have Tryed his Wifes Father
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:205150:98"/>and Mother for Perjury, and to that purpose us'd his urmost endeavor to prevail with Sir <hi>Robert Sawyer</hi> then Attorney-General, to give him leave so to do, both by getting several of his Friends that had Interest with Sir <hi>Robert,</hi> and also Counsel to Plead before him in this matter, (one of his Counsel was his Friend <hi>Christopher Constantine,</hi>) but Sir <hi>Robert</hi> was po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive, that what they, his Wifes Father, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Sister, had Sworn, was not Perjury; but at last Sir <hi>Robert</hi> was prevail'd with to give him leave to Indict One of the Three, and no more Whereupon he pitch'd upon this Mrs. <hi>Castle,</hi> his Wifes Sister, then a Widow, and she was Try'd, as aforesaid. Of this I was an Eye and Ear Witness.

                  <p>As for Mr. <hi>Denney,</hi> he was altogether a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to me, till he Treated with Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> the Embassador's Secretary for the furnishing of my said House he took of me for their Use. The said <hi>Denney</hi> never so much as got a Cup of Drink by me, nor I by him, but <hi>Mill</hi> has Treated the said <hi>Denny</hi> at Fish-Dinners at Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns, at the same time when he Treated, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Embassador's Secretary, and Mr. <hi>Ridgley,</hi> and got the Contract I made with the Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the Rent of the House. I cannot yet learn what <hi>Mill</hi> gave for that Contract, but I have reason to believe it is a large <hi>Item</hi> of the 3000 <hi>l. Mill</hi> has spent in Law. As for <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> he was Mr. <hi>Robert Scott</hi>'s Prentice, and when the said Mr. <hi>Scott</hi> sold his Stock of Books to <hi>Mill</hi> for 10000 <hi>l.

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:205150:103"/>Hall. Notwithstanding this Caution of Mr. <hi>Æ²pman,</hi> the said <hi>Mill</hi> and <hi>Donning</hi> Swore, <hi>That Mr.</hi> Upman <hi>was in the</hi> Common-Pleas-Court <hi>in</hi> Westminster-Hall, <hi>the Fourth Day of</hi> November, <hi>when that</hi> Rule <hi>of</hi> Court <hi>was made.</hi> Upon which Oath, my Lord Chief Justice sent Mr. <hi>Upman</hi> to the <hi>Fleet-Prison,</hi> (and also at the same time Ordered <hi>Mill</hi> the Possession of my Estate,) so my Son, a Lad under Age, but a Commission Officer in the King's Army, Mr. <hi>Æ²pman,</hi> and my other Two Friends, Lay one Night in the <hi>Fleet,</hi> which Night's Lodging Cost them Twenty Pounds. And after this, <hi>Mill</hi> Arrested my Wife, and Mrs. <hi>Lock</hi>'s Wife, for the pretended Ryot, which came to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:205150:104"/>Day of the same Month; he also prov'd his Imprisonment on the said Oath; he also prov'd that he was all that Day at <hi>Stanford-Rivers</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> by not only his own Servants, but by a Couple that he Married that Day at his own Church at Eleven of the Clock, and that he went from thence to his Neighbour <hi>Petree</hi> Esq; where he that Day Din'd, and staid there till Night; so that matter of Fact was fully prov'd; and he also prov'd that <hi>Mill</hi> on the 4th of <hi>November,</hi> told <hi>William Horwood,</hi> That he would certainly send that Black-Coat-Rogue <hi>Æ²pman</hi> to Gaol. <hi>Mill</hi> on the other side, brings out of <hi>London</hi> a great Number of Citizens to Testifie for his Ceedit and Reputation, but who were these Citizens, but Persons that <hi>Mill</hi> Ow'd great Summs of Money to, as Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond Wiseman,</hi> unto whom <hi>Mill</hi> Owes Ten Thousand Pounds. <hi>Robert Scott,</hi> unto whom <hi>Mill</hi> Owes Eight Thousand Pounds. Mr. <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonel</hi> a Paper-merchant, unto whom <hi>Mill</hi> Owes Twelve Hundred Pound; this Man protested on his Soul, <hi>That he did believe</hi> Mill <hi>would not Forswear himself for the World.</hi> And Sir <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Turner,</hi> unto whom <hi>Mill</hi> Owes Fifteen Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pounds, sent his Man, as I am inform'd by one that was of the Jury, to Acquaint them, <hi>Mill was a very Honest Man, and that he dealt with him for many a Hundred Pound.</hi> And to most, if not all, the rest of those that appear'd for his Credit, he the said <hi>Mill</hi> was their Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and that for Considerable Summs, as has appear'd on his Failing in the World, which
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:205150:104"/>was soon after this Tryal. But by the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Jury by the Under-Sheriff, who was one of <hi>Douning</hi>'s Breeding, he having been his Clerk, and since Dead, they brought in <hi>Mill</hi> not Guilty, to the Admiration of the Spectators. But you may imagine they were well paid for this Verdict; indeed I was told, they had Six Guineas a Man, but I will not A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this, but this I will Aver, that one of the Jury-men told me, <hi>They had a Guinea a Man, besides being Treated at the Tavern.</hi> One Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness I would Request of Sir <hi>Edmond Wiseman,</hi> and <hi>Nicholas Donning,</hi> which is, That they would Assist <hi>Adiel Mill</hi> to give a True Account, unto whom, and upon what Account, he has paid the Three Thousand Pounds, he tells Mr. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers Scott,</hi> he has spent in Law. Pray let it be exactly done, as to Summs, and the Persons Names, and Places, who received the same, and upon what Account they had it. It may be very useful in time of Parliament, for their Information, it would Oblige them, to see in what Channels so great a Summ is run into. Some few Days before this Tryal of <hi>Mill</hi> for Perjury, <hi>Mill</hi> gets into the Conversation of one <hi>Margery Penwarden,</hi> a very poor Servant-maid, that some time Liv'd with me, <hi>Whom I Cloth'd when she was even Naked, and Fed when she was Hungry.</hi> This poor silly Maid he carries to the Tavern, spends 12 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> of her, made her Drink off her Glasses of several sorts of Wine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then sends her to <hi>Donning</hi>'s Chamber, where <hi>Donning</hi> draws up an <hi>Affidavit</hi>
                     <pb n="148" facs="tcp:205150:105"/>for her to Swear to before a Master in <hi>Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; Donning</hi> after he had drawn this <hi>Affidavit,</hi> Commands one of his Clerks to Read it to her, and see her put her Hand to it, giving this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why he would not do it, <hi>Because he might be call'd to an Account for it.</hi> As soon as she had made her <hi>Affidavit,</hi> she was sent home to her Master's House, a Black-Smith in the <hi>Hay-Market,</hi> where she immediately fell Sick, and Vomited a Peck, as she her self Confess'd to me the next Day, and that she was never so Sick in all her Life time, crying to me, and telling me, <hi>She had Swore something about a Door I made in my own Dwelling-House before my Imprisonment, and some other things, which she did not know what it was, she having Drunk so much.</hi> This she declar'd before several in the <hi>Fleet-Prison.</hi> But afterwards I found she was sent to me by <hi>Mill</hi> for to Trapan me, for at the Tryal of his Perjury, <hi>Mill</hi> Supena's her, and carries her again to the Tavern that Day, and she being call'd as a Witness, who knew no-nothing of the matter, she Swore, <hi>That my self and Mr.</hi> Upman <hi>would have had her Forswear her self, by Swearing she was Drunk,</hi> But there was no such thing intended, although she her self did confess she was Drunk, and that she Spew'd a Peck. After this, <hi>June</hi> the 4th, 1690, she came again to me in the <hi>Fleet,</hi> and then I suspected that <hi>Mill</hi> had sent her, and therefore I call'd to me one <hi>Christopher Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and <hi>Ann Facey,</hi> and we talking with the said <hi>Margery</hi> about her being a Witness in <hi>Mill</hi>'s
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:205150:105"/>Perjury, the said <hi>Margery</hi> did say, <hi>That she did Swear what they would have her to Swear, and that if she should not stand to what she had Sworn; the said</hi> Mill <hi>did Threaten the said</hi> Margery <hi>to put her in the Pillory.</hi> This <hi>Margery</hi> is not the only Person that <hi>Mill</hi> has sent to Trapan me in my Discourse, for at another time he sent one Mr. <hi>Grace</hi> to me to discourse me about some Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, <hi>Mill</hi> brought him from <hi>Westminster</hi> to <hi>Black-Fryars</hi> by Water, sent him into the <hi>Fleet</hi> to me, and <hi>Mill</hi> went to the <hi>Castle-Tavern</hi> in <hi>Fleet-street,</hi> and staid there till Mr. <hi>Grace</hi> came to him. Mr. <hi>Grace</hi> when he came into the <hi>Fleet</hi> Door, it came into his Heart, he was about an ill Work, <hi>for to Trapan his Landlord,</hi> an Honest Man, <hi>in his Discourse,</hi> he was Resolv'd not to do it, and therefore he Talk'd with me about other matters, and so he went to <hi>Mill</hi> to the <hi>Castle,</hi> where <hi>Donning</hi> was in Company, and there they Examin'd Mr. <hi>Grace,</hi> what the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course was between him and me; which when he had told them, <hi>Donning</hi> told <hi>Mill, That would not do.</hi> And so they sent away Mr. <hi>Grace.</hi> This Account I had from Mr. <hi>Grace</hi>'s own Mouth. And <hi>Mill</hi> was so very Angry with this Mr. <hi>Grace,</hi> that he would not let him be in quiet Possession of his House. This Mr. <hi>Grace</hi> is a Man of about 200 <hi>l. per Annum.</hi> When my Neighbours in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Church-Yard</hi> heard of this my Barbarous and Inhuman Usage, they told <hi>Mill</hi> and <hi>Wiseman. That it was Base and Æ²nchristian-like, to take away all my Estate, and keep my Person in Prison.</hi> Upon
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:205150:106"/>which <hi>Mill</hi> promised several of the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, <hi>That he would no longer keep my Person in Prison.</hi> Acknowledging withall, <hi>That he got nothing by putting me in Prison, nor by keeping me there; nor should suffer any Damage by letting me out of Prison.</hi> Upon this one Day comes my Brother <hi>Æ²pman</hi> to me, and tells me, <hi>I might come out of Prison, if I pleas'd.</hi> I told him, <hi>I should be very well pleas'd to come out of Prison, if I could tell which way.</hi> He told me, <hi>That he had Agreed with</hi> Mill <hi>the Night before, in the presence of</hi> Thomas Dring, <hi>and Mr.</hi> Carbonel <hi>the Younger, that I should be Releas'd out of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi> I Ask'd him, <hi>If</hi> Mill <hi>had sent any Note to the</hi> Warden <hi>of the</hi> Fleet <hi>to Release me.</hi> He An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd, <hi>No, but I must move the</hi> Lords Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners <hi>of the</hi> Great Seal, <hi>and he would have a Counsel by to consent to my Release.</hi> I told him, <hi>The</hi> Lords Commissioners <hi>of the</hi> Great Seal <hi>did not Commit me to Prison. And if I should move for Releasement, his Counsel would be propounding some Terms upon which I should be Released, which might prove further to my prejudice. If he would send a Note to the</hi> Warden <hi>to Release me, the</hi> Warden <hi>could not keep me.</hi> And I told him, <hi>I knew no other way.</hi> Upon which my Brother <hi>Upman</hi> grew Angry. I told him, <hi>Brother,</hi> Mill <hi>has so often deceiv'd me with Breach of Promises, Oaths, and Sacrament, that I cannot, nor will not, believe whatever Promises he makes; for I know, if it be not his Advantage to keep them, he never will keep them. And further,</hi> Brother, <hi>you that have so often blam'd me for trusting to his
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:205150:106"/>Promises, will you your self be now Cheated by his Fallacious Promises.</hi> Upon this <hi>Mill</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, <hi>That he did not keep me in Prison, and that I might come out of Prison if I would.</hi> And the said <hi>Mill</hi> meeting with Mrs. <hi>Ann Facey</hi> the <hi>Chamberlain</hi> of the <hi>Fleet,</hi> told her the same words, as she was coming from the Market home into the <hi>Fleet.</hi> As soon as she came into the <hi>Fleet,</hi> meeting with me, told me, <hi>What</hi> Mr. Pitt, <hi>do you Lie here a Prisoner of your own Choice, for,</hi> saith she, <hi>I met just now with your Adversary</hi> Mill, <hi>and he tells me so, and that he doth not keep you in Prison, you may go out for him.</hi> Upon which I Ask'd her, <hi>If the</hi> Warden <hi>of the</hi> Fleet <hi>would let me go?</hi> She said, <hi>No, not without a Note under</hi> Mill<hi>'s Hand and Seal. That</hi> said I, <hi>He refuseth to give me. Then,</hi> said she, <hi>he is a Lying Rogue.</hi> Upon this, one <hi>Mr. Robert Meldrum,</hi> a Solicitor in <hi>Chancery,</hi> then a Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the <hi>Fleet,</hi> who had the Liberty of the Rules, said to me, Mr. <hi>Pitt, Be not Obstinate, being he has rais'd this Report, That he doth not keep you in Prison, but that you Lie in Prison of Choice, put him to it, and see if he will give you your Liberty, it will satisfie your Friends, and take away the Scandal from you, of Lying in Prison of Choice.</hi> I told him, <hi>Mr. Meldrum, I shall not do it, but if you will undertake it, I shall be thankful to you for it, for I would be very glad to have my Liberty, though I am still of the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, nothing will come of it.</hi> However, Mr. <hi>Meldrum</hi> was willing to undertake it, and did thereupon Write to <hi>Mill,</hi> and told him, <hi>That he
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:205150:107"/>was a Prisoner, and could not come to him;</hi> and withal told him, <hi>That if he had any thing to say about Mr.</hi> Pitt<hi>'s Liberty, if he pleas'd to call at any time on him at his House in</hi> Fleet-Lane, <hi>he had Orders from Mr.</hi> Pitt <hi>to Treat with him.</hi> It was above a Fortnight after this Letter was wrote, before <hi>Mill</hi> came to him, <hi>Thomas Dring</hi> being with <hi>Mill; Mill</hi> desir'd Mr. <hi>Meldrum</hi> to come into the <hi>Fleet</hi> to know of me, <hi>If I would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him to come to drink a Bottle of Wine with me.</hi> I told him, <hi>No, I would have no Conversation with him till I had my Liberty.</hi> Upon this they Three went to the <hi>Three Tuns-Tavern</hi> on <hi>Lud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate-Hill,</hi> and there it was Agreed, that Mr. <hi>Meldrum</hi> should draw up a Note for <hi>Mill</hi> to Sign, the purport of the Note to be this, <hi>That I shouuld Move the</hi> Lords Commissioners <hi>of the</hi> Great Seal, <hi>that I should have my Liberty, and that</hi> Mill <hi>should consent to it; and that my Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty should not be any Advantage, or Disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, to either of us in any of our Hearings, or Tryals, in any of our matters now pending in Their Majesties Courts in Law, or Equity.</hi> Some few Days after <hi>Thomas Dring</hi> calls on Mr. <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drum</hi> for this Note, and Read it, and said, <hi>It was a very Honest Note,</hi> and he would carry it to <hi>Mill,</hi> and he should Sign it, and he would prevail on him to grant me my Liberty. It was about a Fortnight before I could hear any more of this matter, whereupon Mr. <hi>Meldrum</hi> sent a Letter to <hi>Thomas Dring</hi> to know the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why he did not hear from <hi>Mill</hi> about my Liberty. <hi>Thomas Dring</hi> sent Mr. <hi>Meldrum</hi> word,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:205150:107"/>that <hi>Mill</hi> was within two or three Days to go to <hi>Winchester,</hi> where he had a Son, and that as soon as he came home he would grant me my Liberty. Whether he went to <hi>Winchester,</hi> or not, I cannot tell, but I found afterwards, that he, with his Trusty Servant <hi>Benj. Walford,</hi> and <hi>Samuel Smith</hi> a Bookseller in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Church-Yard,</hi> who Serv'd an Apprentiship with me, went to <hi>Portsmouth</hi> to take Possession of two Houses of mine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are Free-hold, that I had Lett for 9 <hi>l.</hi> 10 <hi>s. per Annum.</hi> Soon after he came home from <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> within very few Weeks, <hi>Mill</hi> breaks for between 30000 <hi>l.</hi> and 40000 <hi>l.</hi> (as I am inform'd,) and takes Sanctuary in some Privilege-place belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Grays-Inn,</hi> and there lay for some time, and then was Arrested by Mr. <hi>Robert Scott</hi> for about 8000 <hi>l.</hi> and was in the Bailiffs Hands till the last Day of the Return of the Writ, and then was brought a Prisoner into the <hi>Fleet,</hi> the 28th of <hi>Novemb.</hi> 1690, where he now is a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner, as well as my self. And now being in the <hi>Fleet,</hi> he Treats the <hi>Warden,</hi> and several of the Gentlemen that are Prisoners, and then shews them the Accounts between himself and me, and tells the <hi>Warden, That he doth not keep me Prisoner, but he would let me at Liberty.</hi> The <hi>Warden</hi> telling this to Mr. <hi>Meldrum,</hi> he the said Mr. <hi>Meldrum</hi> Acquaints the <hi>Warden</hi> what steps he had made in it, and the effects of it, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore related. Further, <hi>Mill</hi> Acquaints <hi>Henry Heyman</hi> Esq; and <hi>John Hebdon</hi> Esq; <hi>That if I would come to his Chamber to see him, he would
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:205150:108"/>give me my Liberty, for he pitied my Condition, and knew that I had not a Groat to help my self, and that I was in a starving Condition, and that it was in his power to let me out of Prison, and that it would be no Prejudice to him, and that he would do it with a Christian Temper; and further, that he would get me a Place, whereby I should live Comfortably,</hi> and such Canting Expressions. Mr. <hi>Heyman</hi> upon this promiseth to bring me to his Chamber; and he did, with some Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he us'd, prevail'd with me to go to his Chamber to him, tho' I told him, <hi>it would be to no purpose,</hi> where I found Mr. <hi>Hebdon</hi> with him. And after some short Discourse, he call'd me <hi>Rascal,</hi> and I told him, he was a <hi>False For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sworn Varlet,</hi> and so we parted. Not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, Mr. <hi>Heyman</hi> prevail'd with me again to go with him to <hi>Mill</hi> his Chamber, telling, <hi>Mill</hi> had promised him to be Sedate, and give me a kind Reception, and give me my Liberty. Well, I did go with Mr. <hi>Heyman</hi> to <hi>Mill</hi>'s Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and then he was Sedate, and promised to give me my Liberty in a Fortnights time; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this we parted. Some few Mornings after this, I was a Walking and Reading in the little Garden in the <hi>Fleet,</hi> he seeing of me, comes to me, as I thought in a good Temper, but we had not talk'd much more then a quarter of an Hour, but he fell a Quarrelling with me, and calling me <hi>Rogue</hi> and <hi>Rascal,</hi> and told me, <hi>I did not behave my self towards him, as I ought to do, and that now he would not grant me my Liberty.</hi> I told him, <hi>I never did believe he intended it, for I
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:205150:108"/>had found him to be a Breaker of his Promises, and also a Forsworn</hi> Rogue, and so we parted. As soon as I saw Mr. <hi>Heyman,</hi> I Acquainted him with this passage. About a Fortnight after this, Mr. <hi>Heyman</hi> comes to me, and tells me, I must once more go with him to <hi>Mill,</hi> for he was now alone, and in a very good Humour; and he had agreed with him, that he should grant me my Liberty; and that now he would even Pawn his Life, he would do it. Upon this I went again with Mr. <hi>Heyman</hi> into his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and I found him in a good Humour, and then tells me, <hi>That he would wave talking of all former passages, and that he would grant me my Liberty, and that within a Week, or Ten Days, and that he would help me to a Place, that I should live like a Man, and that I might Assure my self that he was in Earnest, he would pay me Five Shillings a Week whilst I was in Prison.</hi> I told him, <hi>I had often Drunk Water for my Refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and I hoped I should not want Bread, so I would be Contented without his Charity. What,</hi> says he, <hi>Cousin, you will not deny my Kindness? Then,</hi> says he, <hi>I will give Mr.</hi> Heyman <hi>Five Shillings a Week, and he shall pay it you.</hi> I told him, <hi>He might do that as he pleased.</hi> Upon that he gave Mr. <hi>Heyman</hi> Five Shillings, and he gave it me; and he gave Mr. <hi>Heyman</hi> and me his Hand, and promised me my Liberty within a Week, or Ten Days, at farthest; and thus that Evening we parted. Next Morning meeting with Mr. <hi>Heyman,</hi> I told him, <hi>Sir, you think this Man is in Earnest, and that he will grant me
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:205150:109"/>my Liberty.</hi> He told me, <hi>Yes, he did, and that he should wonder at me if I doubted it, for he saw no Reason I should; and that no Man in the World could break such serious Promises; and besides,</hi> he said, <hi>it was no Advantage to him to keep me Prisoner, nor no Disadvantage to him to give me my Liberty, and that if he did not do it, he should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him as great a Rogue as lives.</hi> Upon this I told him, <hi>That he had deceived me with as serious Promises as these, which he hath broken, tho' he has made them with</hi> Oaths, <hi>even the</hi> Sacrament <hi>it self; and that I was satisfied in my Brest, that he would not give me my Liberty;</hi> and what I now said, I desir'd the said Mr. <hi>Heyman</hi> to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, and remember. Well, when the Week was up, Mr. <hi>Heyman</hi> goes to <hi>Mill</hi> to challenge his Promise, <hi>That he should grant me my Liberty. Mill</hi> tells him, <hi>He would not do it then, but he would certainly do it. Then,</hi> says Mr. <hi>Heyman, give me the</hi> 5 s. <hi>you promis'd, for the Week is up;</hi> but he could but get 2 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> of him, and that with much ado. When the next Week came, the said Mr <hi>Heyman</hi> was at <hi>Mill</hi> again, to urge him to be as good as his Promise, and give me my Liberty. He then promised him again, <hi>He would give me my Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, but not yet. Then,</hi> says Mr. <hi>Heyman, pray give me the Moneys you promised him for to Buy Bread, that he may not starve.</hi> Upon that he gave Mr. <hi>Heyman</hi> one Half Crown, and would not give him more, tho' very much urg'd by him. Another Week came, and Mr. <hi>Heyman</hi> was with him again, and told him, <hi>That the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:205150:109"/>time was long since past, that he solemnly Promised both him, and me, to grant me my Liberty.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he Equivocated, and said, <hi>He would give me my Liberty at his own time.</hi> Then he urg'd him to give him the Moneys he promised for my subsistance; the which he also deny'd, and would not, nor never since did, give him one Farthing. Then the said Mr. <hi>Heyman</hi> told him, <hi>That he did believe what the World reported of him, that he was a Rascal;</hi> and so they part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And the said Mr. <hi>Heyman</hi> would never more have any Conversation with him. But he has given out in Words, <hi>That I did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have my self to him as I ought to do, and that now he had resign'd all his Effects into the Hands of his Creditors, and for that reason he could not give me my Liberty.</hi> Now Reader thou mayst perceive by this <hi>Narrative,</hi> who they are that have not only taken away my Estate and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but are persuing after, not only my Life, but the Life of my Wife, and Son, well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that whilst we Live, the Possession of my Estate, which they have got by <hi>Fraud, Bribery, Breach of Trust,</hi> and <hi>Perjury,</hi> can never be well fix'd on them and their Posterity. But I would have <hi>Mill, Wiseman,</hi> and <hi>Donning,</hi> know, that if I Die in Prison, my Wife with Grief and Want, my Son, (a Minor,) in the Wars, That our Blood will be requir'd at their Hands. And further, That those of <hi>Mill</hi>'s Creditors, that Incourage and Assist <hi>Mill, Wiseman,</hi> and <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> to destroy me and my Family, some of our Blood will sprinkle on them, and then Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:205150:110"/>which they will never be able to wipe off, and will be like a Moth in a Garment; and the very Bricks, Morter, and Timber, will Cry for Vengeance, because not paid for, and the Great God will hear <hi>The Cry of the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,</hi> as he has already in part done; for since <hi>Mill</hi> Arrested me, and threw me into Prison, he has Buried out of his Family his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Bore him, and two of his Children, (as I am inform'd,) and he never before Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried one out of his Family, though he always had a very large one; and he himself Broke, and a Prisoner in the <hi>Fleet,</hi> and a <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Bankrupt</hi> taken out against him. And since <hi>Wiseman</hi> has an Order of <hi>Chancery</hi> for to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive my Rents, which is since <hi>Mill</hi> Broke, A Stack of Chimneys, which either <hi>Wiseman,</hi> or those that are concern'd in taking that Great House of mine, in which the Lords of the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty</hi> keep their Office, next St. <hi>James</hi>'s-<hi>Park,</hi> built on the top of the Kitchin-Chimney, was by a Great Wind Blown down, and broke flown the South-wing of the said House next St. <hi>James</hi>'s-<hi>Park,</hi> and a great part of the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras-Court,</hi> to the damage of about 500 <hi>l.</hi> I will tell but Two Stories more of <hi>Mill,</hi> and One of <hi>Wiseman,</hi> and then I will make an end, Some Booksellers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being in Company, a proposal was made to raise some Moneys a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselves for my support, that I might not starve in Prison, <hi>Mill</hi> coming into their Company, and perceiving what they were do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, falls into a Passion, and Ask'd them, <hi>Why
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:205150:110"/>they did Concern themselves about the support of such a Knave and Rogue as I was?</hi> One in the Company Answers, <hi>They never found me but a fare Dealer, and an Honest Man, and Wish'd that he the said</hi> Mill <hi>did prove himself an Honest Man. Well,</hi> says <hi>Mill, within a Fortnight you will see who is the Honest Man,</hi> Pitt, <hi>or</hi> Mill. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that Fortnight <hi>Mill</hi> Broke, (I desire the Reader to be the Judg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>) for the Truth of this Story, I appeal to Mr. <hi>Thomas Sawbridge,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I had not the Story from him. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Story is, <hi>Mill</hi> Borrows 100 <hi>l.</hi> of Captain <hi>Simmons</hi> the Vintner, (who then liv'd at the <hi>Wondern-Tavern</hi> within <hi>Ludgate,</hi>) for some few Days; <hi>Mill</hi> not bringing the said Money to the Captain according to his Promise, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain having sent often to him for it. One Day <hi>Mill</hi> being at the said Tavern, the Captain's Wife Ask'd <hi>Mill,</hi> why he did not pay the 100 <hi>l.</hi> to her Husband he Borrowed of him; <hi>Mill</hi> Promised, <hi>That he would Faithfully pay him the</hi> 100 l. <hi>the next</hi> Friday; She Urg'd him to be sure to keep his Word. He told her, <hi>He Wish'd, he might not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, if he did not pay her Husband the said</hi> 100 <hi>l. before</hi> Friday; but before the <hi>Friday</hi> came <hi>Mill</hi> Broke. This I was told by Captain <hi>Simmons</hi> Wife. Now for <hi>Wiseman,</hi> on the 26th Day of <hi>March,</hi> 1691, comes with his Attorney <hi>Baileys, &amp;c.</hi> to the House of one Mr. <hi>Bath</hi> in <hi>Duke-street,</hi> one of my Tenants, (where he knew my Wife Lodg'd, being the next door to my own Dwelling-House, out of which <hi>Mill</hi>
                     <pb n="160" facs="tcp:205150:111"/>and <hi>Wiseman</hi> had thrown her, notwithstanding an Order in <hi>Chancery, That she should quietly En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Possession of my said House till the ending of the Cause,</hi>) and then Threatned to Sease on all the Goods in my Wifes Possession, (for indeed I cannot call them mine, nor hers, for when <hi>Mill</hi> Arrested me, and seas'd all my Goods, my Wifes Brother Mr. <hi>Æ²pman</hi> bought them of the Sheriff, and so let her have the use of them,) for Rent, that Mr. <hi>Bath</hi> Ow'd, but Mr. <hi>Bath</hi>'s Wife getting up 20 <hi>l.</hi> paid him, and by that means preserv'd the Goods; but at the same time <hi>Wiseman</hi> would have Mrs. <hi>Bath</hi> immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turn my Wife out of Doors, saying, <hi>She was a Turbulans Woman,</hi> and many other ill Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons spoke of her. And further said, <hi>He won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred that any should be so Impudent, as to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her, and he would have her gone off the ground,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Bath</hi> Answered him, <hi>That my Wife Owed her no Moneys, and that she could not turn her away before Quarter-Day.</hi> Upon that he Commands her to turn her away at <hi>Midsum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-Quarter-Day.</hi> And thus we are in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our Dear Lord and Saviour, that we have not a House wherein to lay our Heads. Thus the Reader may see the Mallice of these Unreasonable Men, they would not suffer if it were in their power, my Self, Wife, or Son, to have Bread to Eat, or any place to Lodg in, but would (if the Law did not Protect us,) serve us worse than <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Jesabel</hi> did <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both, Not only take away our Viniard, which we have Planted and Improved with the Sweat of our
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:205150:111"/>Brows,</hi> (which they have already done,) but are doing their utmost Endeavours to take away our Lives also, by Imprisoning all our Persons, and taking away all our Substance, and thereby leaving us in a Starving Condition, which is the worst of Deaths. And therefore I Conclude this Tragical Narrative with that Prayer of <hi>David,</hi> in the 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.14. <hi>Let us now fall into the Hand of the Lord, (for bis Mercies are great,) and let me not fall into the Hand of Man.</hi> For, as the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> saith, (who knew it by Experience,) <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 23. <hi>They are Cruel and have no Mercy.</hi> Again he saith it. <hi>Chap.</hi> 50. <hi>v.</hi> 41. <hi>They are Cruel, and will not shew Mercy.</hi>
